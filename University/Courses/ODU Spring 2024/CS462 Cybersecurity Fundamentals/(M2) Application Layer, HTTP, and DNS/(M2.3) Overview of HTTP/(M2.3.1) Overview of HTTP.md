### Application-Layer Protocols
**The Web**

User agent (client) for the Web is called a *browser*
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari
- MS Internet Explorer

Server for the Web is called a *Web server*
- Apache (public domain)
- MS Internet Information Server (IIS)

**Web Terminology**

Web Page:
- Addressed by a URL
- Consists of "objects"

Most Web Pages Consist Of 
- Base HTML age
- Embedded objects

**URLs (Universal Resource Locators)**

URL Components
- Server address
- (Optional port number)
- Path name

                        pathname vv
Ex: www.someSchool.edu:8080/someDept/pic.gif
hostname ^                    port ^(default 80)

**The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**

This is the Web's application layer protocol

Client/Server Model
- *client*: Browser that requests, receives, "displays" Web objects
- *server*: Web server sends objects in response to requests

**HTTP Example**

User enters URL www.someSchool.edu/someDept/home.index
- Referenced object contains HTML text and references 10 JPEG images

Browser sends an HTTP "GET" request to the server www.someSchool.edu

Server will retrieve and send the HTML file

Browser will read the file and sequentially make 10 separate requests for the embedded JPEG images

**HTTP Overview**

HTTP uses TCP sockets
- Browser initiates TCP connection to server (on port 80)

HTTP messages (application - layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser and Web server

HTTP is "stateless"
- Server maintains no information about past browser requests
