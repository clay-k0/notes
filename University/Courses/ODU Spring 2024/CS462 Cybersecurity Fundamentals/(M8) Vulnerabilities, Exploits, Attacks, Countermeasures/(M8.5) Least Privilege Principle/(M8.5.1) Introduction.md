**Privilege** is the authorization for reading, writing, execution, and deleting
- Every information source and user pair is assigned a privilege relation
	- For instance, in UNIX/Linux/MacOS, three types of permissions (read, write, execute, or rwx) are used for three types of users (owner, owner's group, public)
- A command called change mode, `chmod`, can be used by an owner or administrator to change permissions

**Least Privilege** pertain to having the minimum permission to get a task done
- Root account in Linux and Admin in Windows are most privileged
	- However, a root owner does not have to be logged in as root for everything
	- For email checking, the administrator can use a less privileged account

**High Privileged** accounts left open accidentally can provide privileged access to a prying adversary
