Successful execution of a buffer overflow attack results in arbitrary code execution
- The adversary can have complete control of the application under attack
- A remotely executable buffer overflow exists in many operation systems

Buffer is the memory area reserved for specific data
- For this kind of attack, the buffer is typically used for user input
- If a memory size of $N$ bytes is reserved and the actual size is $K>N$ then the additional $K-N$ bytes are stored in the overflow area
- Buffer overflow can happen intentionally or unintentionally
- It could happen in userspace or kernel space

  
Buffer overflow can occur either remotely or locally, depending on the input mechanism. This input can come from various sources, including:
- Another process or application.
- Input via a network, such as packet size. A very large packet can cause overflow.
- Input from a file.
- User command line or configuration variable size.

The result of the buffer overflow could be any of the following
- A program stores an address too long to read by the browser giving an error of 404 file or webpage not found
- Overwriting memory area reserved for another program, resulting in that program being hung up
- It could signal violation to the memory allocation part of the OS, such as segmentation violation or general protection fault
- Malicious binaries being stored in memory
