If Bob receives a message that he believes is from Alice, he needs to verify:

1. The message has not been modified on its way to Bob - _integrity_
2. The message was actually from Alice - _authentication_

First, let’s look at how we could address concern 1 (that the message hasn’t been modified). This is the issue of message integrity.

A _hash function_ takes an input m and computes a fixed-size string $H(m)$, known as a hash. A _cryptographic hash function_ also requires that it is infeasible to find any two different messages $x$ and $y$ such that $H(x) = H(y)$, meaning that there are no hash collisions.

Using a cryptographic hash function along with an authentication code can provide message integrity. Encryption doesn’t even need to be included.

## SHA-1

An example of a weak hash function is SHA-1. SHA-1 is what's known as a cryptographic hash function. It takes a collection of text, computer code, or other message input and generates a long string of letters and numbers that serve as a cryptographic fingerprint for that message. Even a tiny change, such as the addition or deletion of a single comma in a 5,000-word e-mail, will cause a vastly different hash to be produced. Like all fingerprints, the resulting hash is useful only as long as it's unique. The moment two different message inputs produce the same hash, the so-called collision can open the door to signature forgeries that can be disastrous for the security of banking transactions, software downloads, and website communications.

Summary of a [2014 article](https://konklone.com/post/why-google-is-hurrying-the-web-to-kill-sha-1):

The article states there is an urgent need to phase out the use of the SHA-1 algorithm in SSL certificates due to its vulnerability to attacks. Google's recent announcement of progressively harsh warnings for websites using SHA-1 certificates signals a push towards this goal. The article explains how SSL certificates work, the vulnerabilities of SHA-1, and the potential risks associated with its continued use. It also outlines the actions being taken by different browsers and offers guidance for website operators to transition to SHA-2 certificates. Additionally, it highlights the need for smoother processes in managing SSL certificates and emphasizes the importance of frequent certificate rotation for enhanced security.
