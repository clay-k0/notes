## <u>Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption</u>
### Symmetric Encryption

**A single, shared key**
- Encrypt with the key
- Decrypt with the same key

**Secret key**
- Keep it secret!
- If it gets out, you'll need another key

**Doesn't scale very well**
- Give the key to a lot of people
- Watch them lose the key

**Very fast to use**
- Not a lot of overhead
- Often combined with asymmetric encryption

### Asymmetric Encryption

**Public key cryptography**
- Two keys

**Private key**
- Keep this private

**Public key**
- Anyone can see this way
- Give it away

**The private key is the only key that can decrypt data encrypted with the public key**
- You can't derive the private key from the public key

## <u>Public and Private Keys</u>

#### The Key Pair

**Asymmetric encryption**:
- Public key cryptography

**Key Generation**
- Build both the public and private key at the same time
- Lots of randomization
- Large prime numbers
- Lots and lots of math

#### Digital Signatures

**Sign with the private key**
- The message doesn't need to be encrypted
- Nobody else can sign this

#### Symmetric Key from Asymmetric Key

**Use public and private key cryptography to create symmetric key**
- Math is powerful
