Here’s another way to look at this. Assume that Alice and Bob each have a public key and private key (how they are obtained will be discussed later). We will use the following notations:

- $K_{A}^+$ = Alice’s public key
- $K_{A}^-$ = Alice’s private key
- $K_{B}^+$ = Bob’s public key
- $K_{B}^-$= Bob’s private key

Now, if Alice wants to send an encrypted message, m, to Bob, she uses Bob’s public key and sends K B + (m) to Bob. (How Alice gets Bob’s public key and how she knows that it’s _Bob’s_ public key will also be discussed later.) This message can only be decrypted with Bob’s private key.

To decrypt the message, Bob applies his private key to what Alice sent:

KB- (KB+(m)) = m

This operation also works in reverse. If Alice applies her _private_ key to a message, anyone can decipher the ciphertext, but only with Alice's _public_ key.

Alice: sends KA- (m)  
Bob: m = KA+(KA-(m))

Now if anyone can decipher the message, what good is that? Think about it, and we'll cover it later in this module.
