Since the binomial random variable, $X$, is equal to the number of successes in $n$ trials can be written as a sum of $n$ independent and identical random variables, the central limit theorem implies that $X$ has an approximately normal distribution if $n$ is large.

The binomial distribution will generally be adequate if $np\geq 5$ and $nq\geq 5$. In other words, if the number of successes and the numbers of failures are both expected to be at least 5, then the probabilities for a binomial random variable can be approximated using a normal distribution.

If $p$ is close to 0 or close to 1, then the binomial distribution is highly skewed and the $n$ will have to be quite large for the normal approximate to hold.

The binomial variable is a discrete random variable while a normal distribution is applied to continuous variables. To use the normal approximation to the binomial one needs to first apply the continuity correction to accommodate for estimating a discrete random variable with a continuous distribution. Once the continuity correction is applied, we solve the problem similar to any distribution problem using the formula
$$z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}=\frac{x-np}{\sqrt{ npq }}$$
where $\mu = np$ and $\sigma^2 = npq$ are the mean and variance of the binomial random variable.
