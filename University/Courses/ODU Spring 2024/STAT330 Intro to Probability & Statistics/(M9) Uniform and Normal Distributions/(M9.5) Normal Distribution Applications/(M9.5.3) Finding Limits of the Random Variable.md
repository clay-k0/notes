Now that we have learned to find probabilities for a non-standard normal distribution, we want to reverse our problem and use a probability to find a limit of a non-standard normal distribution. In these problems, we will be solving for a value of the variable $X$. This could be finding a temperature, an IQ score, a height, or a weight. We are given a percentage or area under the normal distribution curve and use this area to find a limit of the variable.

**Procedure:**
1. Sketch a standard normal distribution curve, and identify the given probability or percentage in the appropriate region of the curve.
2. If the area is not already an area to the left, calculate the corresponding area to the left of the unknown limit.
3. Search inside the body of Table A.3 to find the closest area/probability to the area to the left in step 2, then identify the corresponding $Z$-value.
4. Convert from the $Z$-value to an $X$ value using the formula

$$X=\mu+Z\sigma$$

5. Refer to the sketch of the curve to original problem and sketch of the curve to make sure your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.

### Example 1
To qualify for a police academy, candidates must score in the top $10\%$ on the general abilities test. The test has a mean of $200$ and a standard deviation of $20$. Find the lowest possible score to qualify. Assume the test scores are normally distributed.

### Solution
Draw the standard normal distribution curve and identify the top $10\%$

![[finding_limits_top_10_percent_curve.png]]

The top 10% is an area to the right. To find the area to the left subtract $0.10$ from $1$

$1-0.10=0.9000$

Find the closest value to $0.9000$ in [[Courses/ODU Spring 2024/STAT330 Intro to Probability & Statistics/(M9) Uniform and Normal Distributions/(M9.5) Normal Distribution Applications/Resources/Table A3.pdf|Table A3]]. The closest value is $.8997$ with a $Z$-value of $1.28$

Convert from $Z$ to $X$:
$$X=\mu+Z\sigma=200+1.28(20)=225.60$$

To qualify for the police academy, the lower possible score on the general abilities test is $225.6$

### Example 2
For a medical study, a researcher wishes to select people in the middle $60\%$ of the population based on blood pressure. If the mean systolic blood pressure is $120$ and the standard deviation is $8$, find the upper and lower systolic blood pressure readings that would qualify people to participate in the study. Assume systolic blood pressures are normally distributed.

### Solution
Draw the standard normal distribution curve and identify the middle $60\%$

![[finding_limits_middle_60_percent_curve.png]]

We need to find the area to the left of the middle $60\%$. $1-0.60=0.40$ is the area in both the left and right tails combined. $\frac{0.40}{2}=0.20$ is the area in the left tail.

Find the closest value to $.2000$ in Table A.3. Find $.2005$ which has a $Z$-value of $-0.84$. Using symmetry, we know the positive $Z$-value  then $+0.84$

Convert from $Z$ to $X$ for both $Z$-values:
Lower Blood Pressure: $X=\mu+Z\sigma=120-0.84(8)=113.28$
Upper Blood Pressure: $X=\mu+Z\sigma=120+0.84(8)=126.72$

Therefore, to qualify for the medical study, a person’s systolic blood pressure must be between $113.28$ and $126.72$.
