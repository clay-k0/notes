### Universal Instantiation (UI)
$$
\frac{\forall x P(x)}{\therefore P(c)}
$$
**Example:**
	Assume our domain consists of **all dogs**, and we will choose one dog from the domain. Let's choose a dog named "Fido"

**Premise:**
	"All dogs are cuddly."
	In other words, for every x, $Cuddly(x)$ holds true

**Conclusion**
	"**Therefore**, the dog Fido is cuddly."
	In other words, at sample $c$, "Fido", $Cuddly(Fido)$ holds true

This essentially lets us instantiate a sample.

### Universal Generalization (UG)
$$
\frac{P(c)~for~an~arbitrary~c}{\therefore \forall x P(x)}
$$
> [!Note]
The chosen point $c$ must be arbitrarily chosen (nothing specific about it).
In other words, if we change the chosen point $c$, $P$(new chosen sample) still holds true

### Existential Instantiation (EI)
$$
\frac{\exists x P(x)}{\therefore P(c)~for~some~element~c}
$$
**Example:**
	"There is someone who got an A in the course."

**Premise**
	"There exists a student $x$, such that $x$ got an A in the course."

**Conclusion:**
	**Therefore**, at any chosen sample (student $c$), $P(c)$ holds true - "$c$ got an A"

### Existential Generalization (EG)
$$
\frac{P(c)~for~some~element~c}{\therefore \exists x P(x)}
$$
**Example:**
	"Michelle got an A in the class."
	"Therefore, someone got an A in the class."

### Using Rules of Inference
**Example 1:**
Use rules of inference to construct a valid argument that shows
	"John Smith has two legs"
is a consequence of the premises:
	- "Every man has two legs." 
	- "John Smith is a man."

**Solution:**

**Let**
	$M(x)$ = "x is a man"
	$L(x)$ = "x has two legs."
	John Smith is a member of the domain.

**Valid Argument:**

| Step | Reason |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1. $\forall x (M(x) \to L(x))$ | Premise |
| 2. $M(J) \to L(J)$ | Universal Instantiation from 1 |
| 3. $M(J)$ | Premise |
| 4. $L(J)$ | *Modus ponens* from 2 and 3 |
In other words,
$$
\frac{\forall x(M(x) \to L(x))}{\therefore ~L(J)}
$$

**Example 2:**
Solution for Socrates Example

Now, we can finally prove the Socrates example.

**Valid Argument:**

| Step | Reason |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1. $\forall x (Man(x) \to Mortal(x))$ | Premise |
| 2. $Man(Socrates) \to Mortal(Socrates)$ | Universal Instantiation from 1 |
| 3. $Man(Socrates)$ | Premise |
| 4. $Mortal(Socrates)$ | *Modus ponens* from 2 and 3 |

**Example 3:**
Use the rules of inference to construct a valid argument showing that the conclusion
	"Someone who passed the first exam has not read the book"
follows from the premises:
	- "A student in this class has not read the book."
	- "Everyone in this class passed the first exam"

**Solution**

**Let**
	$C(x)$ = "x is in this class"
	$B(x)$ = "x has not read the book"
	$P(x)$ = "x passed the first exam"

**Translate Premises and Conclusion Into Symbolic Form:**
$$
\exists x (C(x) \land \lnot B(x))
$$
$$
\forall x (C(x) \to P(x))
$$
$$
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
$$
$$
\therefore \exists x (P(x) \land \lnot B(x))
$$
This will help us conclude exactly what we need to

**Valid Argument**

| Step | Reason |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1. $\exists x (C(x) \land \lnot B(x))$ | Premise |
| 2. $C(a) \land \lnot B(a)$ | Existential Instantiation from 1 |
| 3. $C(a)$ | Simplification from 2 |
| 4. $\forall x (C(x) \to P(x))$ | Premise |
| 5. $C(a) \to P(a)$ | Universal Instantiation from 4 |
| 6. $P(a)$ | *Modus ponens* from 3 and 5 |
| 7. $\lnot B(a)$ | Simplification from 2 |
| 8. $P(a) \land \lnot B(a)$ | Conjunction from 6 and 7 |
| 9. $\exists x (P(x) \land \lnot B(x))$ | Existential Generalization from 8 |
