### Sorting
To sort the elements of a list is to put them in increasing (or decreasing) order (numerical, alphabetical, etc.)

### Bubble Sort
**Bubble Sort** makes multiple passes through a list. Every pair of elements that are found to be out of order are interchanged

**procedure** *bubblesort*($a_1, \dots, a_n$: real numbers with $n\geq 2$)
**for** $i:=1$ to $n-1$
	**for** $j := 1$ to $n-i$
		**if** $a_{j}>a_{j+1}$ **then** interchange $a_{j}$ and $a_{j+1}$ 
{$a_{1},\dots,a_{n}$ is now in increasing order}

**Example**: Show the steps of bubble sort with 3 2 4 1 5

- At the first pass, the largest element has been put into the correct position
- At the second pass, the $2^{nd}$ largest element has been put into the correct position
- In each subsequent pass, an additional element is put in the correct position

### Insertion Sort
- Insertion sort begins with the $2^{nd}$ element. It compares the $2^{nd}$ element with the $1^{st}$ and puts it before the first if it is not larger.
- Next, the $3^{rd}$ element is put into the correct position among the first 3 elements
- In each subsequent pass, the $n+1^{st}$ element is put into its correct position among the first $n+1$ elements
- Linear search is used to find the correct position

**Example:** Show all steps of the insertion sort with the input 3 2 4 1 5
1. **2 3** 4 1 5 (first two position are interchanged)
2. **2 3 4** 1 5 (third element remains in its position)
3. **1 2 3 4** 5 (fourth element is placed at the beginning)
4. **1 2 3 4 5** (fifth element remains in its position)
