### Algorithms
**Definition:** An algorithm is a finite set of precise instructions for performing a computation or for solving a problem.

**Example:** Describe an algorithm for finding the maximum value in a finite sequence of integers.

**Solution**
- Set the temporary maximum equal to the first integer in the sequence
- Compare the next integer in the sequence to the temporary maximum
	- If it is larger than the temporary maximum, set the temporary maximum equal to this integer
- Repeat the previous step

For example, here's how these steps look in code:
```rust
fn largest_num(data: Vec<u8>) -> u8 {
    let mut temp_max = data[0];
    for num in data {
        if num > temp_max {
            temp_max = num;
        }
    }
    temp_max
}

fn main() {
    let nums = vec![20, 15, 48, 82, 10, 3];
    
    println!("Largest: {:?}", largest_num(nums));
}
```

### Properties of Algorithms
1. **Input**
2. **Output**
3. **Correctness**: Produce the correct output
4. **Finiteness**: Produce the output after a finite number of steps
5. **Definiteness:** The steps must be defined precisely
6. **Effectiveness**: It must be possible to perform each step of the algorithm correctly and in a finite amount of time
7. **Generality**: Should work for all problems of the desired form - not just for some inputs

### Finding the Max Element in a Finite Sequence
We can also see how the steps look in pseudocode:

**procedure** max($a_1,a_{2},\dots,a_{n}$: integers)
$max$ := $a_{1}$
**for** $i:=2$ to $n$
	if $max < a_i$ then $max := a_i$
return $max$ (max is the largest element)

### Some Example Algorithm Problems
Three classes of problems will be covered in this module.

1. **Searching Problems** Finding the position of a particular element in a list
2. **Sorting Problems**: Putting the elements of a list into increasing order
3. **Optimization Problems**: Determining the optimal value (max or min)

### Searching Problems
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search

### Linear vs Binary Search
##### Linear Search Algorithm
The linear search algorithm locates an item in a list by examining elements in the sequence one at a time, starting at the beginning
- First, compare $x$ with $a_1$. If they are equal, return the position 1.
- If not, try $a_2$. If $x=a_2$, return the position 2.
- Keep going, and if no match is found when the entire list is scanned, return 0.

However, the linear search algorithm is not very effective for searching; it would be better if we had a sorted list. To do so, we use binary search.

##### Binary Search Algorithm
1. Assume the input is sorted - increasing order
2. Begin by comparing the element to be found with the middle element
	- If the middle element is lower, the search proceeds with the upper half of the list
	- If it is not lower, the search proceeds with the lower half of the list (through the middle position)
3. Repeat this process until we have a list of size 1
	- If the element we are looking for is equal to the element in the list, the position is returned.
	- Otherwise, 0 is returned to indicate that the element was not found

**Example:** Search for 19 in the list:
1 2 3 5 6 7 8 10 12 13 15 16 18 19 20 22

1. List has 16 elements. The value in the $8^{th}$ position is $10$. Since $19>10$, further search is required
	**1** 2 3 5 6 7 8 **10** <u>12 13 15 16 18 19 20 22</u>

2. The midpoint of the list (position $9$ through $16$) is now the $12^{th}$ position with a value of 16. Since $19>16$, further search is required
	1 2 3 5 6 7 8 10 <u>12 13 15</u> **16** *18 19 20 22*

3. The midpoint now is with a value of $19$. Since $10 \ngtr 19$, further search is restricted to the first half ($18$ and $19$)
	1 2 3 5 6 7 8 10 12 13 15 16 **18** ***19*** 20 22

4. Now, the list has a single element and the loop ends. Since $19=19$ the index 16 is returned
