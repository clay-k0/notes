## Conversions and Assertions

### Conversions

Let's look at something similar we did with our interface composition at some point in our [[(M4.2.1) Decoupling]] program.

```go
// Mover provides support for moving things
type Mover interface {
	Move()
}

// Locker provides support for locking/unlocking things
type Locker interface {
	Lock()
	Unlock()
}

// MoveLocker provides support for moving and locking/unlocking things
type MoveLocker interface {
	Mover
	Locker
}
```

Here, `MoveLocker` is a composition of the `Mover` and `Locker` interfaces.

We can also define our concrete types to work with these:

```go
// bike is a concrete type
type bike struct{}

// Move can change the position of a bike
func (bike) Move() {
	fmt.Println("Moving the bike!")
}

// Lock prevents a bike from moving
func (bike) Lock() {
	fmt.Println("Locking the bike!")
}

// Unlock allows to bike to move after being locked
func (bike) Unlock() {
	fmt.Println("Unlocking the bike!")
}
```

Now, we can implement these in `main` and see how conversion works:

```go
func main() {
	// Declare variables of MoveLocker and Mover interfaces set to their zero value
	var ml MoveLocker
	var m Mover

	// Create a value of type bike and assign it to the MoveLocker interface
	ml = bike{}

	// An interface value of type MoveLocker can be implicitly converted into
	// a value of type Mover. They both decare a method named move.
	m = ml

	// However, if we try to do
	ml = m
	// cannot use m (type Mover) as type MoveLocker in assignment
	// Mover does not implement MoveLocker (missing Lock method)
}
```

`Mover` does not declare methods named `Lock` and `Unlock`, only `Move`. Therefore, the compiler can't perform an implicit conversion to assign a value of interface type `Mover` to an interface value of type `MoveLocker`. It's nice to have this compile-level integrity.

### Assertions

#### Example 1

We've talked about these a bit already, but let's have another look. Adding to `main`:

```go
func main() {
	var ml MoveLocker
	var m Mover

	ml = bike{}
	m = ml

	// Perform a type assertion against the Mover interface value to access
	// a copy of the concrete bike value that was stored inside m
	b := m.(bike)

	// Then, assign the copy of the concrete bike value to the MoveLocker
	ml = b
}
```

If we weren't sure that the value within `m` was a `bike`, recall that we can check by doing

```go
b, ok := m.(bike)
if !ok {
	fmt.Println("This is not a bike...")
}
```

Let's demonstrate this:

```go
// car represents something you drive
type car struct{}

// String implements the fmt.Stringer interface
func (car) String() string {
	return "Vroom!"
}

// cloud represents somewhere you store information
type cloud struct{}

// String implements the fmt.Stringer interface
func (cloud) String() string {
	return "Lots of data!"
}

func main() {
	// Create a slice of the Stringer interface values
	mvs := []fmt.Stringer{
		car{},
		cloud{},
	}

	// Let's run this experiment 10 times
	for range 10 {
		// Choose a random number from 0 to 1
		rn := rand.Intn(2)

		// Perform a type assertion that we have a concrete type
		// of cloud in the interface value we randomly chose
		if v, is := mvs[rn].(cloud); is {
			fmt.Println("Got Lucky:", v)
			continue
		}

		fmt.Println("Got Unlucky...")
	}
}
```

While the validation that we're working with the right type occurs at compile-time, we performed a runtime check.

#### Example 2

Let's look at another instance:

```go
// user defines a user in the system
type user struct {
	name string
	email string
}

// String implements the fmt.Stringer interface
func (u *user) String() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("Name: %q | Email: %q", u.name, u.email)
}

func main() {
	// create a value of type user
	u := user{
		name: "Clay",
		email: "Clay@email.com",
	}

	// display the values
	fmt.Println(u)
	fmt.Println(&u)
}
```

Remember that because we have a pointer receiver, `String`, only when we print `&u` does our user implement `fmt.Stringer`.

Hence, the output is

```sh
{Clay Clay@email.com}
Name: "Clay" | Email: "Clay@email.com"
```

This is great for overwriting default behavior. We can even observe this being used in the `copyBuffer` function within Go's `io` package:

```go
func copyBuffer(dst Writer, src Reader, buf []byte) (written int64, err error) {
	// If the reader has a WriteTo method, use it to do the copy.
	// Avoids an allocation and a copy.
	if wt, ok := src.(WriterTo); ok {
		return wt.WriteTo(dst)
	}

	// Similarly, if the writer has a ReadFrom method, use it to do the copy.
	if rt, ok := dst.(ReaderFrom); ok {
		return rt.ReadFrom(src)
	}
	...
}
```
