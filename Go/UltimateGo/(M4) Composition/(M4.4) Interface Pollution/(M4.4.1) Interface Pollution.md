## Interface Pollution

### Identifying Interface Pollution

One of the things we want to be able to spot right away is interface pollution. It usually occurs when developers try to _design_ with interfaces rather than _discovering_ them.

Consider a situation where a developer is creating a package for TCP server operations:

```go
// Server defines a contract for TCP servers
type Server interface {
	Start() error
	Stop() error
	Wait() error
}
```

This code might seem reasonable at first glance, but it has several issues:

- The name `Server` is a noun, describing a thing. Interfaces should only describe behavior instead of concrete entities
- It introduces three methods prematurely, without clear evidence they are all necessary from the start. 
- If this is the developer's only implementation and they are _not_ asking other developers to implement this, this should be a clear sight of designing over discovering.

That was only the first handful of lines of the program. Further exploration of the code reveals additional concerns:

```go
// server is our Server implementation
type server struct {
	host string
	// ...
}

// NewServer returns an interface value of type Server
// with a server implementation
func NewServer(host string) Server {
	// SMELL - using an non-exported type as an interface return type
	return &server{host}
}

// Start allows the server to begin to accept requests
func (s *server) Start() error {
	// ...
	return nil
}

// Stop shuts down the server
func (s *server) Stop() error {
	// ...
	return nil
}

// Wait prevents the server from accepting new connections
func (s *server) Wait() error {
	// ...
	return nil
}

func main() {
	// Create a new Server
	srv := NewServer("localhost")

	// Use the API
	srv.Start()
	srv.Stop()
	srv.Wait()
}
```

The use of the interface in `NewServer` and `main` doesn't really provide any benefits.

Let's clean up the interface pollution and favor a concrete `Server` instead:

```go
package main

// Server is our concrete Server implementation
type Server struct {
	host string
	// ...
}

// NewServer instantiates a Server with the provided hostname
func NewServer(host string) *Server {
	return &Server{host}
}

// Start allows the Server to begin to accept requests
func (s *Server) Start() error {
	// ...
	return nil
}

// Stop shuts down the Server
func (s *Server) Stop() error {
	// ...
	return nil
}

// Wait prevents the Server from accepting new connections
func (s *Server) Wait() error {
	// ...
	return nil
}

func main() {
	// Create a new Server
	srv := NewServer("localhost")

	// Use the API
	srv.Start()
	srv.Stop()
	srv.Wait()
```

This approach mitigates unnecessary allocations and makes the code more straightforward for its users.

### Guidelines

To avoid interface pollution, the following guidelines should be followed:

- Implement interfaces when external users need to provide custom implementations.
- Use interfaces for decoupling when multiple internal implementations exist.
- Interfaces are useful for supporting extensible features; however, if an interface is only used for testing purposes, its necessity should be reevaluated.
