## Decoupling

### Preface

It's important to always start by drafting code; it shouldn't be perfect right off the bat.

With the following program, we will

- Employ all the mechanics and semantics we've learned. 
- Demonstrate one of Rob Pike's biggest philosophies in Go, _discovering_ our interfaces.
- Observe how to write code in well-defined layers

### Scenario

A client has an old system, `Xenia`, that uses a proprietary database containing valuable data. Their modern money-making system, `Pillar`, uses a more traditional database and extends better APIs. How can we move the valuable data from the Xenia to Pillar?

#### Breaking it Down

The main focuses with the task are:

1. Connecting to the `Xenia` database
2. Identifying the data within Xenia and moving it out
3. Connecting to the `Pillar` database
4. Storing the `Xenia` data into the `Pillar` database

These are _primitive_ problems and we should prototype each of them. In V1:

- First, we need to build an API to solve the primitive problems.
- Second, we need to build a low-level API on top of this
- Third, we need to build a high-level API on top of this

Once these are in place, we can refactor in future versions accordingly.

## V1

#### Primitive API Layer

Let's focus on structuring instead of implementation within our primitive layer:

```go
package main

import (
  "errors"
  "fmt"
  "io"
  "math/rand"
  "time"
)

// Data is the structure of the data we are copying
type Data struct {
  Line string
}

// Xenia is a system we need to pull data from
type Xenia struct {
  Host string
  Timeout time.Duration
}

// Pull knows how to pull data out of Xenia
func (*Xenia) Pull(d *Data) error {
  switch rand.Intn(10) {
  case 1, 9:
    return io.EOF
  case 5:
    return errors.New("Error reading data")
  default:
    d.Line = "Data"
    fmt.Println("In:", d.Line)
    return nil
  }
}

// Pillar is a system we need to store data into
type Pillar struct {
  Host string
  Timeout time.Duration
}

// Store knows how to store data into Pillar
func (p *Pillar) Store(d *Data) error {
  fmt.Println("Out:", d.Line)
  return nil
}
```

Because this is our first draft of code:

- Ignore questions like "Are we really going to call `Pull` for every single piece of data we have?"
- We don't care about optimizing this primitive problem for performance, only for correctness.

With our primitive layer in place, we can move on to our low-level layer: 

### Low-Level API Layer

When we start thinking about our low-level API, we see that we have two systems with two unique behaviors, so we might want to create a new concrete type called `System` that can hold both systems. It will get its behavior from the embedding:

```go
// System wraps Xenia and Pillar together into a single system
type System struct {
  Xenia
  Pillar
}
```

This isn't necessarily the ultimate solution, it's just something that works. 

> [!Note]
>
> Our code should use functions as much as possible while it's reasonable/practical to do so. 

We used a method-based API for `Xenia` and `Pillar` since they're state. Now, we'll use a function-based API in our lower level.

Let's create a function to pull bulk data from `Xenia`:

```go
// pull knows how to pull bulks of data from Xenia
func pull(x *Xenia, data []Data) (int, error) {
  for i := range data {
    err := x.Pull(&data[i]); 
    if err != nil {
      return i, err
    }
  }
  return len(data), nil
}
```

Similarly, we can create a function to store the bulk data:

```go
// store knows how to store bulks of data into Pillar
func store(p *Pillar, data []Data) (int, error) {
  for i := range data {
    err := p.Store(&data[i])
    if err != nil {
      return i, err
    }
  }
  return len(data), nil
}
```

This is our first implementation of our low-level API.

### High-Level API Layer

Now, we can leverage one singular function that uses these `pull` and `store` functions. Notice the pattern to the layering?

We'll call it `Copy`:

```go
// Copy knows how to pull and store data from the System
func Copy(sys *System, batch int) error {
  data := make([]Data, batch)

  for {
    i, err := pull(&sys.Xenia, data)
    if i > 0 {
      _, err := store(&sys.Pillar, data[:i])
      if err != nil {
        return err
      }
    }

    if err != nil {
      return err
    }
  }
}
```

Note the signature:

```go
func Copy(sys *System, batch int) error {...}
```

This function accepts a `*System`, which lets us use our `pull` and `store` behaviors. It also accepts `batch`, a batch size. The first line of our body is

```go
data := make([]Data, batch)
```

We can see the value of `batch` isn't known at runtime, meaning that it will be constructed on the heap, but it won't hurt us.

Then, we create an infinite loop and use `pull` and `store` with our systems and check for errors.

### `main`

Within `main`, we can setup these systems and interact with them:

```go
func main() {
  sys := System{
    Xenia: Xenia{
      Host: "localhost:8080",
      Timeout: time.Second,
    },
    Pillar: Pillar{
      Host: "localhost:9090",
      Timeout: time.Second,
    },
  }

  err := Copy(&sys, 3)
  if err != io.EOF {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
}
```

This first concrete implementation is fast enough, tested and therefore production-ready, but we're not done.

### What Now?

It's important to understand what "done" really means:

- **Test Coverage:** While our ultimate goal is 100% test coverage, at least 70% is good for now.
- **Implementation:** We should evaluate our concrete implementation and foresee any changes that will be made.

What events might show up that require change?

What if our client tells us they have two new projects:

- `Candy`, which needs its DB data migrated over to `Pillar` and
- `Alesis`, which is a server similar to `Pillar`, and needs data from `Xenia` and `Candy`?

In this case, our systems are going to change. To implement this in V2, we'll decouple our program by discovering our interfaces.

## V2

### Low-Level API Layer

We'll focus on our low-level API since it only has one behavior. We'll also compose our small interfaces to larger ones.

Recall our low-level:

```go
// pull knows how to pull bulks of data from Xenia
func pull(x *Xenia, data []Data) (int, error) {
  for i := range data {
    err := x.Pull(&data[i]); 
    if err != nil {
      return i, err
    }
  }
  return len(data), nil
}

// store knows how to store bulks of data into Pillar
func store(p *Pillar, data []Data) (int, error) {
  for i := range data {
    err := p.Store(&data[i])
    if err != nil {
      return i, err
    }
  }
  return len(data), nil
}
```

Notice `pull` and `store` accept `*Xenia` and `*Pillar`, respectively. These are based on what the data _is_ rather than what the data _does_. We want the function to focus on the latter. We know `Xenia` is able to `Pull` and `Pillar` is able to `Store`, so we could create respective interfaces for them:

```go
type Puller interface {
  Pull(d *Data) error
}
```

```go
type Storer interface {
  Store(d *Data) error
}
```

Then, we can use them in our `pull` and `store` functions:

```go
func pull(p Puller, data []Data) (int, error) {
  for i := range data {
    err := p.Pull(&data[i]); 
    if err != nil {
      return i, err
    }
  }
  return len(data), nil
}
```

```go
func store(s Storer, data []Data) (int, error) {
  for i := range data {
    err := s.Store(&data[i]); 
    if err != nil {
      return i, err
    }
  }
  return len(data), nil
}
```

We've just _discovered_ two new interfaces. We already had working implementations for `Pull` and `Store`, so there was no guessing what their signatures should look like.

### High-Level API Layer

We're still not done, though. Our high-level API's `Copy` function still uses the concrete `System`:

```go
func Copy(sys *System, batch int) error {
  data := make([]Data, batch)

  for {
    i, err := pull(&sys.Xenia, data)
    if i > 0 {
      _, err := store(&sys.Pillar, data)
      if err != nil {
        return err
      }
    }

    if err != nil {
      return err
    }
  }
}
```

We know that a `System` should consist of both `Puller` and `Storer` capabilities, so a common interface composition to use in this case is creating a `PullStorer` interface to leverage both:

```go
type PullStorer interface {
  Puller
  Storer
}
```

Notice how we're able to define our low-level API interfaces, `Puller` and `Storer`, then use them in `PullStorer` within our high-level API.

Now, we can update `Copy`:

```go
func Copy(ps PullStorer, batch int) error {
  data := make([]Data, batch)

  for {
    i, err := pull(ps, data)
    if i > 0 {
      _, err := store(ps, data[:i])
      if err != nil {
        return err
      }
    }

    if err != nil {
      return err
    }
  }
}
```

However, notice our `pull` and `store` signatures compared to our calls to them in `Copy`:

```go
func pull(p Puller, data []Data) (int, error)
pull(ps, data)
```

```go
func store(s Storer, data []Data) (int, error)
store(ps, data)
```

Why does `ps` work as both a `Puller` and a `Storer`? Well, remember, we're not asking for `Puller` and `Storer` values; interfaces are valueless. We're simply asking for any concrete data that knows how to _behave_ like they do. Therefore, we're actually passing a pointer to our system within `ps`.

We still need to decouple `main`.

### `main`

Recall how `main` looks:

```go
func main() {
  sys := System{
    Xenia: Xenia{
      Host: "localhost:8080",
      Timeout: time.Second,
    },
    Pillar: Pillar{
      Host: "localhost:9090",
      Timeout: time.Second,
    },
  }

  err := Copy(&sys, 3)
  if err != io.EOF {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
}
```

Notice how we're still using our concrete `System` type here. How can we easily use `Candy` and `Alesis`? One solution could be to keep creating new systems:

```go
type System struct {
  Xenia
  Pillar
}

type System2 struct {
  Candy
  Pillar
}

type System3 struct {
  Candy
  Alesis
}

...
```

But this would become too tedious as our application grows.

Let's actually move the `Puller` and `Storer` interfaces in `System`:

```go
type System struct {
  Puller
  Storer
}
```

This way, we can inject data into `System`, decoupling behavior at the type level.

Let's update `main`:

```go
func main() {
  sys := System{
    Puller: &Xenia{
      Host: "localhost:8080",
      Timeout: time.Second,
    },
    Storer: &Pillar{
      Host: "localhost:9090",
      Timeout: time.Second,
    },
  }

  err := Copy(&sys, 3)
  if err != io.EOF {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
}
```

### Reviewing What We've Got

Now, our program is fully decoupled. However, it's still important to look for any improvements that can be made:

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

type Data struct {
	Line string
}

type Puller interface {
  Pull(d *Data) error
}

type Storer interface {
  Store(d *Data) error
}

type PullStorer interface {
	Puller
	Storer
}

type Xenia struct {
	Host    string
	Timeout time.Duration
}

func (*Xenia) Pull(d *Data) error {
	switch rand.Intn(10) {
	case 1, 9:
		return io.EOF
	case 5:
		return errors.New("Error reading data")
	default:
		d.Line = "Data"
		fmt.Println("In:", d.Line)
		return nil
	}
}

type Pillar struct {
	Host    string
	Timeout time.Duration
}

func (p *Pillar) Store(d *Data) error {
	fmt.Println("Out:", d.Line)
	return nil
}

func pull(p Puller, data []Data) (int, error) {
  for i := range data {
    err := p.Pull(&data[i]); 
    if err != nil {
      return i, err
    }
  }
  return len(data), nil
}

func store(s Storer, data []Data) (int, error) {
	for i := range data {
		err := s.Store(&data[i])
		if err != nil {
			return i, err
		}
	}
	return len(data), nil
}

func Copy(ps PullStorer, batch int) error {
  data := make([]Data, batch)

  for {
    i, err := pull(ps, data)
    if i > 0 {
      _, err := store(ps, data[:i])
      if err != nil {
        return err
      }
    }

    if err != nil {
      return err
    }
  }
}

func main() {
	sys := System{
    Puller: &Xenia{
      Host: "localhost:8080",
      Timeout: time.Second,
    },
    Storer: &Pillar{
      Host: "localhost:9090",
      Timeout: time.Second,
    },
  }

  err := Copy(&sys, 3)
  if err != io.EOF {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
}
```

Let's take a closer look at the `Copy` function in our high-level API. Currently, it utilizes a `PullStorer` interface. We need to evaluate the necessity of this interface — as of now, it's only used once in `Copy`. Given that we can now inject dependencies directly into the `System`, maintaining the `PullStorer` interface is redundant. To simplify, we should remove the `PullStorer` and modify `Copy` to accept two separate parameters: one for `Puller` behavior and another for `Storer` behavior:

```go
func Copy(p Puller, s Storer, batch int) error {
  data := make([]Data, batch)

  for {
    i, err := pull(p, data)
    if i > 0 {
      _, err := store(s, data[:i])
      if err != nil {
        return err
      }
    }

    if err != nil {
      return err
    }
  }
}
```

With this change, we no longer need `System`.

Now, we can update `main` accordingly:

```go
func main() {
	x := Xenia{
		Host:    "localhost:8080",
		Timeout: time.Second,
	}

	p := Pillar{
		Host:    "localhost:9090",
		Timeout: time.Second,
	}

	err := Copy(&x, &p, 3)
	if err != io.EOF {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
}
```

### The Decoupled Program

Here's our fully updated decoupled program:

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

type Data struct {
	Line string
}

type Puller interface {
	Pull(d *Data) error
}

type Storer interface {
	Store(d *Data) error
}

type Xenia struct {
	Host    string
	Timeout time.Duration
}

func (*Xenia) Pull(d *Data) error {
	switch rand.Intn(10) {
	case 1, 9:
		return io.EOF
	case 5:
		return errors.New("Error reading data")
	default:
		d.Line = "Data"
		fmt.Println("In:", d.Line)
		return nil
	}
}

type Pillar struct {
	Host    string
	Timeout time.Duration
}

func (p *Pillar) Store(d *Data) error {
	fmt.Println("Out:", d.Line)
	return nil
}

func pull(p Puller, data []Data) (int, error) {
	for i := range data {
		err := p.Pull(&data[i])
		if err != nil {
			return i, err
		}
	}
	return len(data), nil
}

func store(s Storer, data []Data) (int, error) {
	for i := range data {
		err := s.Store(&data[i])
		if err != nil {
			return i, err
		}
	}
	return len(data), nil
}

func Copy(p Puller, s Storer, batch int) error {
	data := make([]Data, batch)

	for {
		i, err := pull(p, data)
		if i > 0 {
			_, err := store(s, data[:i])
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}
		}

		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	x := Xenia{
		Host:    "localhost:8080",
		Timeout: time.Second,
	}
	p := Pillar{
		Host:    "localhost:9090",
		Timeout: time.Second,
	}

	err := Copy(&x, &p, 3)
	if err != io.EOF {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
}
```

All the steps we took to refactor solution are never going to happen on day one. Following the process of 

1. Drafting and Prototyping
2. Creating API Layers
3. Iterative Refinement
4. Decoupling/Modularization
5. Continual Improvement

are key in writing scalable and reliable Go design patterns.
