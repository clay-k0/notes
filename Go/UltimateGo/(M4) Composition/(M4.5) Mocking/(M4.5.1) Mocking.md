## Mocking

Ideal tests in Go only work with concrete data (i.e., concrete input leads to concrete output), making mocking a solution of last resort. The preferred approach is refactoring our code to enhance its testability.

When it comes to mocking, Go compiler uses static code analysis to hold users (rather than the developers) responsible for APIs.

### Scenario

Consider implementing a Go PubSub package from scratch for a client's messaging bus, without external dependencies like RabbitMQ or Kafka. Suppose we're this far in the implementation:

```go
package pubsub

// PubSub provides access to a queue system
type PubSub struct {
	host string

	// ...
}

// New creates a pubsub value for use
func New(host string) *PubSub {
	ps := PubSub{
		host: host,
	}
}

// 10 more idiomatic methods...
```

#### Mocking-Free Approach

How can we test this? While we could start by writing mocks, real binary protocols are present, making them unnecessary. Utilizing Docker to containerize the message bus allows tests to interact with a real system. Let's assume we choose this approach and instruct the services developer accordingly.

#### Mock Approach

The developer returns, explaining their inability to access the container in their testing environment and requesting data mocking instead. This situation justifies mocking. Even if they ask us to define an interface for testing, developers in Go can create mocking interfaces themselves:

```go
package main

// import the pubsub package here

// publisher is an interface to allow this package to mock the pubsub
// package support
type publisher interface {
	Publish(key string, v interface{}) error
	Subscribe(key string) error
}

// mock is a concrete type to help support the mocking of pubsub package
type mock struct{}

// Publish implements the publisher interface for the mock
func (m *mock) Publish(kev string, v interface{}) error {
	// mock publish logic
	return nil
}

// Subscribe implements the publisher interface for the mock
func (m *mock)Subscribe(key string) error {
	// mock subscribe logic
	return nil
}

func main() {
	// Create a slice of publisher interface values and assign the
	// address of a pubsub.PubSub value and the address of a mock value
	pubs := []publisher{
		pubsub.New("localhost"),
		&mock{},
	}

	// Range over the interface value to see how the publisher interface
	// provides the level of decouplign the user needs. The pubsub package
	// didn't need to provide the interface type.
	for _, p := range pubs {
		p.Publish("key", "value")
		p.Subscribe("key")
	}
}
```

This allows the developer to meet their requirements as necessary. However, Docker should generally be favored over mocking for testing purposes.
