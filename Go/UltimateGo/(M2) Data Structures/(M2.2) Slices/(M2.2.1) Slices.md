## Slices

Slices in Go are essentially dynamic arrays. They are also part of the _reference types_.

### Slice Declaration

#### Zero Value Declaration (Nil Slice)

Slices can be declared without initialization, starting as `nil`:

```go
var averages []float64
```

#### Using `make`

Declare a slice with a specified length and, optionally, capacity:

```go
averages := make([]float64, 5)    // where 5 is the length
averages := make([]float64, 5, 8) // where 8 is the cap
```

#### Initialized with Values

Directly initialize a slice with specific values:

```go
averages := []float64{32.5, 37.1, 23.4, 5.4, 10.2}
```

### Slices as Function Parameters

Slices are passed to functions by reference, meaning modifications to the slice within the function affect the original slice. However, the pointer, length, and capacity are copied:

```go
func inspectSlice(slice []float64) {
	fmt.Printf("len: %d, cap: %d\n", len(slice), cap(slice))
	for i, v := range slice {
		fmt.Printf("i: %d, &slice[i]: %p, v: %.2f\n", i, &slice[i], v)
	}
}
```

> [!Note]

> Don't pass a pointer to a slice (`*[]float64`); slices are already reference types.

### Modifying Slices

#### Appending Elements

We can append elements to slices using the `append` function:

```go
averages = append(averages, 3.14)
```

In this case, we increase the length of `averages`.

#### Slicing a Slice

Sub-slices are created by slicing a slice. Note that the end index is _exclusive_:

```go
sliceOfAverages := averages[1:2] // Includes element at index 1 only
```
