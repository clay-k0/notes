## Go Scheduler Mechanics

### Key Concepts

| Concept                | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Concurrency            | Execution of instructions out of order to achieve a result.                                             |
| Parallelism            | Execution of multiple instructions simultaneously.                                                      |
| OS Scheduler Mechanics | OS schedulers create an illusion that multiple programs run simultaneously, even on a single processor. |
| Hardware Threads       | A single processor executes one instruction at a time; multiple threads enable parallel execution.      |
| OS Threads             | Manage program instructions, transitioning between running, runnable, and waiting states.               |
| Scheduler Period       | The timeframe in which runnable threads are scheduled.                                                  |
| Time Slice             | The allocation of time for each thread within a scheduler period.                                       |
| Context Switch         | The overhead caused by switching between threads, impacting performance.                                |

### Components

| Component                    | Description                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logical Processors (Ps)      | Correspond to hardware threads, each managing an OS thread (M) and a queue of Go routines (G).                  |
| Go Scheduler Semantics       | Identifies hardware threads to determine the number of logical processors. Go routines operate atop OS threads. |
| Cooperative Scheduler        | Relies on function call transitions as safe points for scheduling decisions.                                    |
| Context Switch in Go         | More efficient, taking approximately 200 nanoseconds compared to OS context switches (1-2 microseconds).        |
| Events Triggering Scheduling | Includes the Go keyword, garbage collection, system calls, and blocking calls.                                  |
| Network Poller               | Manages asynchronous system calls, mainly for networking, freeing up M to handle more work.                     |
| Handling Synchronous Calls   | Detaches blocking M and brings in a new M to continue work, maintaining efficiency.                             |
| Work Stealing                | Idle Ps can steal Go routines from other Ps or the global run queue, balancing the workload.                    |

## Practical Considerations in Scheduling

| Consideration                     | Impact                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Efficiency with Parallel Execution | Multiple Ps allow Go routines to run in parallel, enhancing throughput for CPU-bound workloads.                 |
| Transforming IO Bound Work        | The scheduler turns IO-bound work into CPU-bound work, reducing the load on the OS scheduler.                   |
| Optimal Thread Utilization        | Match Go routines to hardware threads for CPU-bound tasks; leverage lightweight Go routines for IO-bound tasks. |
| Context Switch Efficiency         | Reduced context switch time enhances performance, especially for IO-bound operations.                           |
