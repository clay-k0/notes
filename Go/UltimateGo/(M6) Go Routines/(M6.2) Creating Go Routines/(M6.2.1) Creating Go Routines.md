## Creating Go Routines

### Synchronization vs. Orchestration

- **Synchronization**: Goroutines wait in line to take turns (e.g., waiting to speak to a barista at a coffee shop).
- **Orchestration**: Interaction between goroutines (e.g., ordering coffee and exchanging money with the barista).

#### Synchronization Primitives:

- **Timers:** Used to manage timing-related waits.
- **Mutexes:** Ensure that only one goroutine accesses a shared resource at a time.

#### Orchestration Primitives:

**Channels:** Facilitate communication and coordination between multiple goroutines.

#### Guidelines

- Always use the correct primitive for the problem at hand to avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Avoid using orchestration tools like channels for synchronization tasks and vice versa to maintain clarity and efficiency in code.

### Example 1

Consider the following code that demonstrates how to create Go Routines using `sync.Waitgroup`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
	"sync"
)

// allocate 1 processor for the scheduler to use
func init() {
	runtime.GOMAXPROCS(1)
}

func hello() {
	for range 10 {
		fmt.Println("Called hello")
	}
}

func goodbye() {
	for range 10 {
		fmt.Println("Called goodbye")
	}
}

func main() {
	// wg is used to manage concurrency
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(2)

	fmt.Println("starting goroutines")

	// create a goroutine that calls hello
	go func() {
		hello()
		wg.Done()
	}()

	// create a goroutine that calls goodbye
	go func() {
		goodbye()
		wg.Done()
	}()

	// wait for the goroutines to finish
	fmt.Println("\ndone starting, waiting to finish:")
	wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("\nfinished, terminating")
}
```

Notice how our concurrent goroutines run out of order. 
### Example 2

Here's another example that shows how the scheduler behaves and context switches:

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/sha1"
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
	"strconv"
	"sync"
)

// allocate 1 processor for the scheduler to use
func init() {
	runtime.GOMAXPROCS(1)
}

// printHashes calculates the sha1 hash for a range
// of numbers and prints each in hex encoding
func printHashes(prefix string) {
	// change the range to 10 and 50000 to see scheduler behavior
	for i := 1; i < 10; i++ {
		// convert i to a string
		num := strconv.Itoa(i)

		// calculate hash for string num
		sum := sha1.Sum([]byte(num))

		// Print prefix: 5-digit-number: hex encoded hash
		fmt.Printf("%s: %05d: %x\n", prefix, i, sum)
	}

	fmt.Println("Completed", prefix)
}

func main() {
	// wg is used to manage concurrency
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(2)

	fmt.Println("starting goroutines")

	// create a goroutine and manage its lifecycle
	go func() {
		printHashes("A")
		wg.Done()
	}()

	// create a goroutine and manage its lifecycle
	go func() {
		printHashes("B")
		wg.Done()
	}()

	// wait for the goroutines to finish
	fmt.Println("\ndone starting, waiting to finish:")
	wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("\nfinished, terminating")
}
```

How many times do we see a context switch between `printHashes("A")` and `printHashes("B")`? We can use the following command to find out (The code for this program is located in this directory):

```sh
./example2 | cut -c1 | grep '[AB]' | uniq
```

One run might look like

```
B
A
B
A
B
A
B
A
```

While another run might look like

```
B
A
B
A
B
```

There's really no predictability due to the scheduler.

### Example 3

Let's tweak our first example and make it multi-threaded:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
	"sync"
)

// allocate 2 processors for the scheduler to use
func init() {
	runtime.GOMAXPROCS(2)
}

func main() {
	// wg is used to manage concurrency
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(2)

	fmt.Println("starting goroutines")

	// declare an anonymous function and create a goroutine
	go func() {
		// display the alphabet in lowercase 3 times
		for count := 0; count < 3; count++ {
			for r := 'a'; r <= 'z'; r++ {
				fmt.Printf("%c ", r)
			}
		}

		// Tell main we're done
		wg.Done()
	}()

	// declare an anonymous function and create a goroutine
	go func() {
		// display the alphabet in uppercase 3 times
		for count := 0; count < 3; count++ {
			for r := 'A'; r <= 'Z'; r++ {
				fmt.Printf("%c ", r)
			}
		}

		// Tell main we're done
		wg.Done()
	}()

	// wait for the goroutines to finish
	fmt.Println("\ndone starting, waiting to finish:")
	wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("\nfinished, terminating")
}
```

Because we use 2 threads, our output has hardware-level randomness rather than Go-level randomness.
