## Managing Data Races

When creating goroutines, managing and controlling the paths of execution is crucial in multi-threaded software. A data race occurs when at least two goroutines, one performing a read and another performing a write, access the same memory location simultaneously. This leads to unpredictability.

### Common Data Race Example

Let's look at a basic example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var counter int // shared state

func main() {
	const grs = 2

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(grs)

	for i := 0; i < grs; i++ {
		go func() {
			for count := 0; count < 2; count++ {
				value := counter // read
				value++          // modify
				counter = value  // write
			}

			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
    wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("Final Counter:", counter)
}
```

This program outputs

```
Final Counter: 4
```

This appears correct, but it hides a data race.

#### Data Race Goes In Production 

Suppose the code is deployed and runs fine for months. A new developer adds logging to understand the program, but forgets to remove it:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var counter int

func main() {
	const grs = 2

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(grs)

	for i := 0; i < grs; i++ {
		go func() {
			for count := 0; count < 2; count++ {
				value := counter
				value++
				fmt.Println("logging") // logging statement
				counter = value
			}

			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
    wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("Final Counter:", counter)
}
```

Now, the output is:

```
logging
logging
logging
logging
Final Counter: 2
```

The `counter` is unexpectedly 2 due to a data race caused by context switching from the `fmt.Println` statement.

#### Detecting Data Races

Go provides a data race detector, which can be used with `go build -race` or `go test -race`. For Mac users, `go test -race -cpu 24` (where 24 is three times the number of cores) is recommended for accuracy.

Running the detector might produce something similar to:

```
logging
logging
logging

```

If the output shows a data race that doesn't appear obvious, it shouldn't simply be patched; the architecture might need to be reworked.

#### The Fix: Synchronization

To prevent data races, synchronization is necessary. Two common approaches are:

1. Atomic Instructions
2. Mutexes

##### Atomic Instructions

Atomic instructions are the fastest but can only synchronize a word or half a word in memory at a time. For our integer counter, we can use atomic operations:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
)

var counter int32 // counter is now an int32

func main() {
	const grs = 2

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(grs)

	for i := 0; i < grs; i++ {
		go func() {
			for count := 0; count < 2; count++ {
				atomic.AddInt32(&counter, 1)
			}
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
	wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("Final Counter:", counter)
}
```

This ensures the counter increments atomically and correctly.

##### Mutexes

To ensure our non-atomic operations are handled properly, we need to use a mutex. Mutexes allow multiple lines of code to execute atomically by providing synchronization. You can think of it as creating a "room" of code: while our code is in the room, goroutines come to the door and request entry. The scheduler ensures that only one goroutine at a time can enter the room, execute the code, and then leave.

When a goroutine requests access, it must call `Lock`, and when it leaves, it must call `Unlock`. It's crucial that a goroutine calling `Lock` also calls `Unlock` to prevent deadlocks. Note that mutexes are not queues, so the first goroutine to request access may not be the first to enter. Additionally, the time it takes to execute the code in the room introduces latency, which can be a performance bottleneck.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var counter int

func main() {
	const grs = 2

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(grs)

	var mu sync.Mutex

	for i := 0; i < grs; i++ {
		go func() {
			for count := 0; count < 2; count++ {
				mu.Lock()
				// "room" of code
				{
					value := counter
					value++
					counter = value
				}
				mu.Unlock()
			}

			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
	wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("Final Counter:", counter)
}
```

Mutexes ensure that the `counter` is updated correctly, even with logging statements. However, to minimize latency, unnecessary operations like logging should be kept outside the critical section.

#### Wrapping It Up

- Use atomic instructions when dealing with simple data types.
- Use mutexes when synchronizing multiple lines of code.
- No one line of code is inherently synchronous.
- Inform the compiler about synchronization needs to avoid unexpected data races.

Next, we'll explore orchestration, which handles communication between goroutines.
