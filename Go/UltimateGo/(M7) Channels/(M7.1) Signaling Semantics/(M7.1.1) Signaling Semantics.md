## Signaling Semantics

**Channels** in Go provide a simple way to orchestrate goroutines by allowing one goroutine to signal another about an event. It's crucial to understand that channels are not data structure queues but are used for signaling.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Signaling vs. Data Structures**:
    - Channels are used for signaling between goroutines, not for data queuing.
    - They can signal with or without data.

2. **Send and Receive**:
    - Unlike reading and writing, channels use `send` and `receive`.
	    - It is essential to consider if a guarantee is needed that the signal sent is received.

3. **Guarantees**:
    - If a guarantee is required, the receive must happen before the send, ensuring the signal is received. This can introduce latency.
    - Without the guarantee, latency can be reduced or eliminated, but it introduces risk.

4. **Channel States**:
    - **Open**: Created using `make`, allowing sends and receives.
    - **Zero Value (nil)**: Sends and receives block, useful for rate limiting or event loops.
    - **Closed**: Used for cancellations and shutdowns, changes the state from open to closed.

5. **Signaling Patterns**:
    - **One-to-One**: Sending a signal with data from one goroutine to another.
    - **One-to-Many**: Signaling multiple goroutines without data by closing a channel, similar to turning off lights in an auditorium.

### Practical Scenario:

Consider a manager-employee relationship where the manager needs to ensure the employee receives the task. Initially, the manager waits for the employee to arrive to hand over the task, ensuring it is received. This is analogous to requiring a guarantee.

In the second scenario, the manager leaves the task on the desk for the employee to find later, removing the guarantee that the task is immediately received but reducing the time the manager has to wait (latency).
