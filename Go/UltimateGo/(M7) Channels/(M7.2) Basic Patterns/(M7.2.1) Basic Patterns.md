## Basic Patterns

### Wait For Result

In this pattern, we launch a goroutine to do some work, wait for it to finish, then wait for the result.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func waitForResults() {
	ch := make(chan string) // unbuffered channel

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(500)) * time.Millisecond)
		ch <- "Go!"
		fmt.Println("Employee sent the signal")
	}()

	signal := <-ch // unary receive operation to wait for the goroutine
	fmt.Println("Manager received the signal:", signal)

	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	fmt.Println("--------------------------------------------------------")
}

func main() {
	waitForResults()
}
```

After running this code a few times, we notice that in some cases, the send message appears first, and other times, the receive message appears first; there's no guarantee of the order. However, there is a guarantee that we first send a signal to the channel, then receive it.

This pattern will be useful in fan out patterns.
