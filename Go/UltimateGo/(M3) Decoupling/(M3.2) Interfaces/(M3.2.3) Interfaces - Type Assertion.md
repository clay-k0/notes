## Interfaces: Type Assertion

### The Empty Interface + Type Assertion

The empty interface `interface{}` does not describe any methods, meaning that any type satisfies this interface because every type implements at least zero methods. It's often used as a generic container for values in situations where the specific type might not be known until runtime.

Type assertion will allow us to retrieve the concrete type of an interface.

### Example

Let's see how empty interfaces work with the idea of type assertion in the following code:

`fmt.Println` can be called with values of any type:

```go
fmt.Println("Hello, world")
fmt.Println(12345)
fmt.Println(3.1415)
fmt.Println(true)

myPrintln("Hello, world")
myPrintln(12345)
myPrintln(3.1415)
myPrintln(true)
```

How can we implement our own version of the function called `myPrintln` and use it the same way?

We could write the function as

```go
func myPrintln(a interface{}) {
	switch v := a.(type) {
	case string:
		fmt.Printf("type(%T)\t :: value(%s)\n", v, v)
	case int:
		fmt.Printf("type(%T)\t :: value(%d)\n", v, v)
	case float64:
		fmt.Printf("type(%T)\t :: value(%f)\n", v, v)
	default:
		fmt.Printf("type(%T)\t :: value(%v)\n", v, v)
	}
}
```

which accepts an empty interface. What does this empty interface describe? Nothing, not even what it does, so we have to perform _type assertion_ to figure out the type of the value passed in at runtime.

### Explicit Type Assertion

We can also check to see if a value is a certain type using the "comma ok" idiom. For instance,

```go
var i interface{} = "Hello"

str, ok := i.(string)
if !ok {
	fmt.Println("Not a string!")
}
fmt.Println(str)
```

If `i` is _not_ a string, `ok` holds the value `false` and we print the appropriate message to the user. Otherwise, `str` will hold the string `"Hello"`, `ok` will be `true`, and we print the `str` value to the user.
