## Interfaces: Storage by Value

### Storage by Value

Here's another program that makes use of storage by value within an interface:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// printer displays information
type printer interface {
	print()
}

// user defines a user in the program
type user struct {
	name string
}

// print displays the user's name
func (u user) print() {
	fmt.Printf("User Name: %s\n", u.name)
}

func main() {
	// create a user value
	u := user{"Bill"}

	// Add the value and pointer of u to the slice of
	// printer interface values
	entities := []printer{u, &u}

	// change the name field of the user
	u.name = "Jill"

	// Iterate over the slice of entities and call print()
	// against the copied interface value
	for _, e := range entities {
		e.print()
	}
}
```

Notice we create a slice of printers, `entities`, which of holds pieces of concrete data that implement `printer`. This is an example of when both value and pointer semantics can be used with interfaces, and how they behave differently when the underlying data is modified after being stored in the interface.

The output of the program is

```sh
User Name: Bill
User Name: Jill
```

When we call `e.print()`:

- The first element (`u` as a value), displays "User Name: Bill" because it was added to the slice before the name was changed to "Jill". This reflects the state of `u` at the time it was added to the slice.
- The second element (`&u` as a pointer), displays "User Name: Jill" because it points to the current state of `u`, which has the updated name "Jill".

The idea here is that if we want to have a collection of concrete data, we have to implement based on what it does instead of what it is.
