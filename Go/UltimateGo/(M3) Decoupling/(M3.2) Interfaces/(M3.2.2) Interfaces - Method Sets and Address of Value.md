## Interfaces: Method Sets and Address of Value

### Going Further

Let's create another polymorphic program and introduce some new ideas:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// notifier is an interface that defines notification type bahvior
type notifier interface {
	notify()
}

// user represents a user in the program
type user struct {
	name  string
	email string
}

// notify is a pointer receiver that implements the notifier interface
func (u *user) notify() {
	fmt.Printf("sending user email to %s<%s>\n", u.name, u.email)
}

// sendNotification accepts a value that implements the notifier 
// interface and sends notifications
func sendNotification(n notifier) {
	n.notify()
}

func main() {
	u := user{"clay", "clay@email.com"}

	// Because the values of type user use pointer semantics,
	// they do not implement the notifier interface
	sendNotification(u)
	// Therefore, we get an error:
	// cannot use u (variable of type user) as notifier value in argument to
	// sendNotification: user does not implement notifier 
	// (method notify has pointer receiver)
}
```

The error we receive is a helpful gesture, stating that we try to pass a copy to pointer receiver, but why does it happen? The answer is the method set rules defined by Go.

### Method Set Rules/Address of Value

Let's take a look at the method set rules defined by the Go spec:

| Type                      | Result                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Value/Copy (i.e `user`)   | _Only_ value receivers can attach                            |
| Pointer/Address (`*user`) | _Both_ pointer and value receivers can attach to the address |

If we look at this in terms of behavior, the picture becomes clearer: 

Values only support value receivers because we can't always assume its address can be obtained. However, how come both pointer/value receivers can be used with addresses? Well, behavior-wise, we use pointer receivers to share, but we can use value receivers in the aforementioned cases of `Decode` or `Unmarshal`.

Therefore, we now know that

```go
sendNotification(u)
```

made a _copy_ of the user. In order the program to compile successfully, we need to pass the user as a pointer:

```go
sendNotification(&u)
```
