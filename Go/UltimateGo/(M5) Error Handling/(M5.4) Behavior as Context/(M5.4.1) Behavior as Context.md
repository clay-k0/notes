## Behavior as Context

To maintain our decoupled state using the `errors` package, we'll use behavior as our context (rather than type).

### Revisiting Type as Context

Consider the following snippet reiterating our idea of type as context:

```go
// client represents a single connection in the room
type client struct {
    name string
}

// TypeAsContext shows how to check multiple types of possible custom error
// types that can be returned from the net package.
func (c *client) TypeAsContext() {
    for {
        line, err := c.reader.ReadString('\n')
        if err != nil {
            switch e := err.(type) {
            case *net.OpError:
                if !e.Temporary() {
                    log.Println("Temporary: Client leaving chat")
                    return
                }
            case *net.AddrError:
                if !e.Temporary() {
                    log.Println("Temporary: Client leaving chat")
                    return
                }
            case *net.DNSConfigError:
                if !e.Temporary() {
                    log.Println("Temporary: Client leaving chat")
                    return
                }   
            default:
                if err == io.EOF {
                    log.Println("EOF: Client leaving chat")
                    return
                }
                log.Println("read-routine", err)
            }
        }
        fmt.Println(line)
    }
}
```

Notice that in each error case based on the _type_ of net error, we try to validate whether or not the error is temporary.

### Behavior as Context

Now, let's see how we can base it on the _behavior_:

```go
// temporary is declared to test for the existence of the method coming
// from the net package
type temporary interface {
	Temporary() bool
}

// BehaviorAsContext shows how to check for the behavior of an interface
// that can be returned from the net package
func (c *client) BehaviorAsContext() {
	for {
		line, err := c.reader.ReadString('\n')
		if err != nil {
			switch e := err.(type) {
			case temporary:
				if !e.Temporary() {
					log.Println("Temporary: Client leaving chat")
					return
				}
			default:
				if err == io.EOF {
					log.Println("EOF: Client leaving chat")
					return
				}
				log.Println("read-routine", err)
			}
		}
		fmt.Println(line)
	}
}
```

This example demonstrates a more flexible and maintainable approach by focusing on the behavior (`Temporary() bool`) of the error, allowing any error that implements this method to be handled appropriately.
