## Default Error Values

"Systems cannot be developed assuming that human beings will be able to write millions of lines of code without making mistakes, and debugging alone is not an efficient way to develop reliable systems." - Al Aho (inventor of AWK)

Error handling in Go should show the user of the API enough context for informed decisions when things don't go as planned. Nearly every function we write will return a potential error, making it a significant aspect of API design.

Let's first start with this piece of code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// http://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#error
type error interface {
	Error() string
}

// http://golang.org/src/pkg/errors/errors.go
type errorString struct {
	str string
}

// http://golang.org/src/pkg/errors/errors.go
func (e *errorString) Error() string {
	return e.str
}
```

- First, we encounter an `error` interface defined within the language, hence its non-exported appearance. This serves as the fundamental interface for error handling.
- Next, we encounter a concrete type named `errorString` from the errors package. In Go, errors are simply values. This `errorString` type is decoupled by our `error` interface. Note that this will be the most commonly used type, and both the concrete type and its field are non-exported.
- Last, the `error` interface is implemented through a pointer receiver, returning the `str` string. This serves dual purposes: allowing the value to function as an error value and facilitating logging (the returned string should not be parsed).

Let's continue:

```go
// http://golang.org/src/pkg/errors/errors.go
// New returns an error that formats the given text
func New(text string) error {
	return &errorString{text}
}
```

Notice here the factory function `New` returns an `error` interface. Despite our earlier assertion that factory functions should only return concrete data, this is an exception; we always want to interact with the `error` interface.

```go
func main() {
	if err := webCall(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Life is good")
}

// webCall performs a web operation
func webCall() error {
	return New("Bad Request")
}
```

Observe that the `webCall` function we call always returns a "Bad Request" error created by our factory function.

`nil` is the zero-value for our `error` interface, a reference type. When we check `err != nil`, we're asking if a concrete value is stored inside the `error` interface. Thus, if it contains a value, we have an error. By using this syntax, we can do things like

```go
	if err := webCall(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	
	if err := webCall(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
```

where `err` is scoped to each `if` statement. It also facilitates clear error handling, making it preferable to avoid using `else` statements.
