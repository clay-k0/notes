### Wireless Encryption
**All wireless computers are radio transmitters and receivers**
	- Anyone can listen in

**Solution: Encrypt the data**
- Everyone gets the password

**Only people with the password can transmit and listen**
- WEP and WPA

-  - -
### WEP (Wire Equivalent Privacy)
**Different levels of encryption key strength**
- 64-bit or 128-bit key size

**WEP cryptographic vulnerabilities identified in 2001**
- The first bytes of the output keystream are "strongly non-random"
- Gather enough packets and you can easily discover the entire WEP key

**Don't use WEP...**

### WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
**WPA: RC4 with TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)**
- Initialization Vector (IV) is larger and an encrypted hash
- Every packet gets a unique encryption key
- A short-term workaround

**WPA2 certification began in 2004**
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) replaced RC4
- CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining) Message Authentication Code Protocol) replaced TKIP

**WPA2-Enterprise adds 802.1X**
- RADIUS server authentication
