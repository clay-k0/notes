## Block and Stream Ciphers

#### Block Ciphers
**Symmetric encryption**
- Not used in asymmetric encryption

**Encrypt fixed-length groups**
- Often 64-bit or 128-bit blocks
- Pad added to short blocks

**Confusion**
- The key to ciphertext relationship should be very complicated
- Can't determine the key based on the ciphertext

**Diffusion**
- Output should depend on the input in a complex way
- Change one bit of the input, at least 50% of the output should be different

#### Stream Ciphers
**Also used with symmetric encryption**
- Same as the block cipher

**Encryption is done one bit or byte at a time**
- High speed, low hardware complexity

**The starting state should never be the same twice**
- The key is often combined with an initialization vector (IV)

## Symmetric Encryption Ciphers

### RC4
**Rivest Cipher 4**
- Ron Rivest (Ron's Code 4)

**Part of the ill-fated WEP standard**
- Also part of SSL

**RC4 has a "biased output**
- If the third byte of the original state is zero and the second byte is not equal to two, then the second output byte is always zero.

### DES and 3DES
**Data Encryption Standard**
- DES and Triple DES

**Developed between 1972 and 1977 by IDM for the NSA**
- One of the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)

**64-bit block cipher**
- 56-bit key (very small in modern times)

**3DES**
- Encrypt with DES three times
	- Three keys, two keys, or the same key three times

**Superseded by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**

### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
**US Federal Government Standard**
- FIPS 197 in 2001
- It took 5 years to standardize it
- Developed by two Belgian cryptographers
	- Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen

**128-bit block cipher**
- 128-, 192-, and 256-bit keys

**Used in WPA2**
- Powerful wireless encryption

### Blowfish and Twofish
**Blowfish**
- Designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier
- 64-bit block cipher, variable length key (1 to 448 bits)
- No known way to break the full 16 rounds of encryption
- One of the first secure ciphers not limited by patents (no patent, public domain)

**Twofish**
- Successor to Blowfish
- 128-bit block size, key sizes up to 256
- Designed by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting,
- David Wagner, Chris Hall, Niels Ferguson, Stefan Lucks, Tadayoshi Kohno, and Mike Stay
- No patent, public domain
