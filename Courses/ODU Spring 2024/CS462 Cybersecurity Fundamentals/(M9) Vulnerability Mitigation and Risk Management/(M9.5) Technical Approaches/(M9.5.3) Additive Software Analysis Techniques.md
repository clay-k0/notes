Defined as a comprehensive approach for addressing impediments to the use of multiple advanced software checking tools. Most IDEs don't provide an analysis interface for tools.

A key output of additive software analysis will be a new generation of user-facing tools to readily combine the outputs from different tools and techniques into unified, more comprehensive assessments of a piece of software.

A comprehensive additive software analysis capability must facilitate tools working together, provide building blocks to jumpstart new tool development and facilitate integration and interoperability among tools. Hence, it must include standards, a framework, and techniques to combine analysis results.
