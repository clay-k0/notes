Formal methods include all software analysis approaches based on mathematics and logic, including parsing, type checking, correctness proofs, model-based development, and correct-by-construction.

Advances in algorithms for solving Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems, satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), decision procedures (e.g. ordered binary devision diagrams - OBDD) and reasoning models (e.g. abstract interpretation and separating logic) dramatically slashed resources required to answer questions about software validation.
