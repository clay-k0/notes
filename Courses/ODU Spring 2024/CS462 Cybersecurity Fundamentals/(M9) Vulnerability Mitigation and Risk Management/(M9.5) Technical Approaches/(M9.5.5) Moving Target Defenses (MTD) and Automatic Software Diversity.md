### Moving Target Defense (MTD) Techniques

MTD techniques automatically very software's detailed structures and properties such that an attacker has much greater difficulty exploiting any weakness.

Example: Heap Memory Randomization
- **Buffer Allocation:** When a program requests a buffer, the easiest thing to return is a chunk of the next available memory
- **Relative Location:** This leads to buffers being in the same relative location, facilitating attacks.
- **Buffer Overflow (BOF) Exploitation** Attackers can exploit BOF weaknesses, such as reading passwords from buffers located predictably

Heap memory randomization allocates a random additional amount of memory during each allocation
- **Unpredictable Locations:** Buffers are placed in different, unpredictable relative locations, making exploits like the above much harder or even impossible.

### Goal of Software Diversity and MTD
The primary aim of software diversity and MTD is to reduce an attacker's ability to exploit software vulnerabilities
- **Not About Reducing Weaknesses:** It's important to note that the goal isn't to reduce the number of weaknesses.

This reduction may be achieved by
- **Changing Attack Surface:** Modifying the interface accessible to attackers over time (dynamic changes during operation) or across copies (diversity)
- **Regenerating Compromised Components:** Another approach to enhance security can include regenerating system components that have been compromised
