### Trust Relations within an Organization
The organizational structure relies on various types of trust relationships:
- Trust among employees is fundamental for the organizational structure to function effectively.
- Trust must also extend to external organizations within the security industry, such as those providing feedback and alerts like CERT.
- Trust within its own domain is essential for smooth operations.
- Certification authorities (CAs) play a crucial role in establishing trust by issuing certificates for public keys, creating trust relationships between CAs.

### Establishing Trust
To ensure the establishment of trust, specific controls are necessary:
- Implement separation of duties within the organization to prevent vulnerabilities
	- Address insider threats, which are a significant cause of security breaches, by identifying potential sources of vulnerability among personnel
- Apply the principle of least privilege to limit access to information only to those who require it
- Classify both personnel and information to ensure appropriate levels of access control for confidentiality and integrity preservation

### Security Architectures
Security architectures such as Bell La Padula (BLP) and Biba are used for classified information:
- BLP prevents information disclosure to lower clearance levels by restricting lower levels from reading higher-level information
- Biba protects the integrity of classified information by restricting lower levels from writing to higher levels

### Handling Internal Trust Connections
The NIST [Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf) facilitates monitoring and controlling access to internal trust connections
- It offers tailored guidance to meet specific organizational needs
- The `Protect` category within CSF addresses various security requirement, including access control, awareness, data security, policies and procedures, maintenance, and technology protection
- The `Identify` category focuses on security requirements related to asset management, business objectives, and regulatory policies.
By implementing measures from both the `Protect` and `Identify` categories, organizations can effectively manage and monitor trust relationships to achieve their business objectives.
