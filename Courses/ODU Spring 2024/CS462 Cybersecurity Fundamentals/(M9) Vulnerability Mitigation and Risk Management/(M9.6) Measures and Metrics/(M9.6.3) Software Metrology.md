### Measuring High-Level Properties
In software metrology, the aim is to measure high-level properties such as **quality**, **maintainability**, and **security**. However, precise definitions for these properties are often lacking, making direct measurement challenging.

We can, however, measure many properties that are correlated with those high-level properties
- Currently, metrology relegates counting the number of entities to a second-class method of determining properties
- **Counted Quantities:** may represent different kinds of data (such as counting instances of certain events), but they are all classified under the same dimension, commonly referred to as **dimension one** or **dimensionless quantities**.
