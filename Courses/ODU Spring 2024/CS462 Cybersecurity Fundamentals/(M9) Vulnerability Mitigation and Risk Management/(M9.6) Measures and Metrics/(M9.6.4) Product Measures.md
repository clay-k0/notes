While a good process is crucial for producing code with minimal vulnerabilities, the ultimate capability is measuring the code itself.

### Security and Vulnerability Measurement
- Security or vulnerability measurements encompasses both testing and checking
- Such measurement shouldn't be deferred until the final deployment; it must be integrated into all phases of software development.


Process checking is embedded within **CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)**
- CMMI serves as a framework to guide process improvement across various scopes, including a project, division, or entire organization
