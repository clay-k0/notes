- Mitigating vulnerabilities is quite challenging due to their diverse nature
- Software vulnerabilities registered in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) are easier to deal with using patches and best practices
- Hardware configuration vulnerabilities that don't stem from hardware architecture (chip malfunctioning, etc.) also demand adherence to best practices
- Insider threats require policies such as least privilege
- Password-related vulnerabilities require several measures
	- Password rules, login attempts, botnet defense, computer usage rules
- More common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow require in-depth analysis
	- We begin by addressing the mitigation of buffer overflow
