### Example Overflow
**Stack Overflow**
- In this case of overflow, values of the local variables can use more stack space than allocated to individual variables
- This can result in pushing the return address of the calling function to a value different from the actual value
- In one attack, the new value for a return function is shell code
	- This can give the attacker the ability to enter shell commands (bash in UNIX)
- It can also point to a code loaded by the hacker

**Stack Overflow Countermeasures**
- A countermeasure to the above is not to allow any code executed from within a function
- A better countermeasure is to do input validation
