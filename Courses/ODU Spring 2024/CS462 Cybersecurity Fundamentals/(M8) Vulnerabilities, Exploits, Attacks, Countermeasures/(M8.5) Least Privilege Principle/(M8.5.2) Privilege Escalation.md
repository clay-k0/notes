**Privilege Escalation** pertains to illegally obtaining a higher privilege
- It could be by a legitimate user with otherwise lower access
- It could be by a hacker who sneaks in using a lower access process and then changes their privilege level
- Typical for rootkits

It provides a hacker with access to kernel level processes
- Kernel processes can have a higher level of privilege than even the root
	- For example, Windows processes manage other processes by linking each process into a doubly linked list for resource management
- A hacker, after escalating their privilege, can eliminate a process and insert malware
