- When two processors or threads run concurrently (parallel), they may need to share data
	- A race condition can occur if two threads attempt to modify shared data simultaneously
		- Since the scheduler for threads can be invoked at any time, it introduces uncertainty
- Race conditions can be prevented by properly serializing concurrent threads
	- While one thread is executing, its data should not be altered by another thread
- As a bug, a race condition can lead to a programming semantic error or an abnormal program exit
- As a vulnerability, it can provide an opportunity for an attacker to inject code
	- The attacker can exploit various consequences of a race condition, including:
		- Using temporary files with the same name as legitimate files to read/write
		- Exploiting case-insensitive file naming
		- Inserting symbolic links for malicious files where the application can read or write data
		- Replacing one of multiple hard links with an attacker's file
