- Numeric overflow (or underflow) happens when a data type's range of values is exceeded.
	- It can lead to program halting due to an exception
- Overflow occurs when a number surpasses the maximum value that a data type can store
	- For instance, an unsigned byte type value exceeding 255
	- If numbers are stored in 1's or 2's complement form, overflow an alter the number's sign
		- When such a number is used as a loop counter, it may result in abnormal program termination or an infinite loop
- Underflow happens when an input number is too small to be stored
	- For example, a number stored using IEEE 754 single precision being smaller than $2^{-127}$


- Numerical overflow and underflows can be mitigated through best programming practices
	- Using unsigned integers in scenarios where negative numbers are not applicable, like age, data, array indexes, etc,
- Employing double or extended precision for handling small quantities, such as sub-atomic particles or inter-galactic simulations
- Most programming languages offer exception handling mechanisms
	- Exception handling can prevent the execution of code in response to unwanted numerical outcomes, such as negative array indexes
