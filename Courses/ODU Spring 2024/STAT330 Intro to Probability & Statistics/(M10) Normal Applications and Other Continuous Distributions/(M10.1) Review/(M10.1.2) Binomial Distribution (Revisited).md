A binomial experiment must satisfy the following requirements:
- The experiment consists of $n$ independent and identical (iid) trials
- Each trial has 2 possible outcomes, _Success_ and _Failure_
- The per trial probability, $p$, that a _Success_ occurs must remain constant for each trial

Let $X$ be the number of _Successes_ in $n$ trials. $X$ is a **binomial random variable**.
The probability distribution function (PDF) of $X$ is
$$f(x)={n \choose x}p^x q^{n-x},~x=0,1,2,\dots,n$$
where

$n$ = # of trials
$p$ = per trial probability of _Success_
$q$ = per trial probability of _Failure_ = $1-p$

A binomial random variable has the following properties:
**Mean:** $\mu=np$
**Variance:** $\sigma^2=npq$
**Standard Deviation:** $\sigma=\sqrt{ npq }$
