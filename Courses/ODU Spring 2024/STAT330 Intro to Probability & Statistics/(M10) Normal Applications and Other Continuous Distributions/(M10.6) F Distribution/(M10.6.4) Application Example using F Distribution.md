### Application Example
**Problem:** Two independent normal populations have variances of $4$ and $2$, respectively. A random sample of size $16$ is taken from each population and the sample variances are $1.5$ and $0.3125$, respectively. Find the probability that the ratio of $\frac{\sigma_{2}^2s_{1}^2}{\sigma_{1}^2s_{2}^2}$ is greater than the observed samples.

**Solution:**
1. Identify key values: 
	- $n_{1}=16, ~ ~\nu_{1}=15$
	- $n_{2}=16,~ ~ \nu_{2}=15$
	- $\sigma_{1}^2=4$
	- $\sigma_{2}^2=2$
	- $s_{1}^2=1.5$
	- $s_{2}^2=0.3125$
2. Plug these in to our formula
	- $\frac{\sigma_{2}^2s_{1}^2}{\sigma_{1}^2s_{2}^2}=\frac{2(1.5)}{4(0.3125)}=2.40$
3. Thus, $P(F(15,15)>2.40)=0.05$ which can be observed from [Table A.6](./Resources/Table%20A6%20-%20Critical%20Values%20of%20the%20F%20Distribution.pdf).
