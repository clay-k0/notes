**Theorem:** Let $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ be independent random variables having chi-square distributions with degrees of freedom $\nu_{1}$ and $\nu_{2}$, respectively. Then, $$F(\nu_{1},\nu_{2})=\frac{\frac{U_{1}}{\nu_{1}}}{\frac{U_{2}}{\nu_{2}}}$$
is a random variable that has an $F$ distribution with
- $\nu_{1}$ = numerator degrees of freedom
- $\nu_{2}$ = denominator degrees of freedom

Suppose two samples of size $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are selected independently from populations with variances $\sigma_{1}^2$ and $\sigma_{2}^2$

| Population | Population Mean | Population Variance | Sample Size | Sample Mean       | Sample Variance |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| 1          | $\mu_{1}$       | $\sigma_{1}^2$      | $n_{1}$     | $\overline x_{1}$ | $s_{1}^2$       |
| 2          | $\mu_{2}$       | $\sigma_{2}^2$      | $n_{2}$     | $\overline x_{2}$ | $s_{2}^2$       |
Since the samples are selected independently, $s_{1}^2$ and $s_{2}^2$ are independent random variables.

If both populations have normal distributions, then 
$$U_{1}=\frac{(n_{1}-1)s_{1}^2}{\sigma_{1}^2}$$is chi-squared with $df=n_1-1$

and
$$U_{2}=\frac{(n_{2}-1)s_{2}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2}$$
is chi-squared with $df=n_{2}-1$

By the above theorem, $$F(n_{1}-1,~n_{2}-1)=\frac{U_{1}/n_{1}-1}{U_{2}/n_{2}-1}=\frac{s_{1}^2/\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{1}^2s_{2}^2}=\frac{\sigma_{2}^2s_{1}^2}{\sigma_{1}^2\sigma_{2}^2}$$

**Theorem Takeaway:** Let $s_{1}^2$ and $s_{2}^2$ denote sample variances for samples of sizes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ selected from independent normal populations with variances $\sigma_{1}^2$ and $\sigma_{2}^2$. Then, 
$$F(n_{1}-1,~n_{2}-1)=\frac{\sigma_{2}^2s_{1}^2}{\sigma_{1}^2\sigma_{2}^2}$$
That is, the ratio on the right-hand-size has an $F$ distribution with the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom indicated on the left-hand-side.
