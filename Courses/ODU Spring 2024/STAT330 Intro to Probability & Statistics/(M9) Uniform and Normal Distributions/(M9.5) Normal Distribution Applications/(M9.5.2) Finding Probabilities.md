Let's look at some more example for finding probabilities for a non-standard normal distribution

### Example 1
Each month, an American household generates an average of 28 pounds of paper for garbage or recycling. Assume the standard deviation is 2 pounds. If a household is selected at random, find the probability of it generating between 28 and 31 pounds per month.

### Solution
Amount generated has a mean of $\mu = 28$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 2$; therefore, we have a non-standard normal distribution (mean is not 0 and standard deviation is not 1). We can write the problem as:

$P(27<X<31)=~?$

We now need to convert this problem to a standard normal distribution by converting 28 and 31 into $Z$-values.
$$Z=\frac{{X-\mu}}{\sigma}=\frac{{27-28}}{2}=-0.5$$
$$Z=\frac{{X-\mu}}{\sigma}=\frac{{31-28}}{2}=1.5$$

$P(27<X<21)=P(-0.5<Z<1.5)=~?$

Now we have a standard normal distribution problem. Note that we had two $X$ values there we found two $Z$-scores.

[[Courses/ODU Spring 2024/STAT330 Intro to Probability & Statistics/(M10) Normal Applications and Other Continuous Distributions/(M10.2) Central Limit Theorem/Resources/Table A3.pdf|Table A3]] gives us the area to the left of $Z=1.5$ as $0.9332$ and the are to the left of $Z=-0.5$ as $0.3085$

The area between $-0.5$ and $1.5$ is $0.9332-0.3085=0.6247$

Therefore, the probability that a household generates between 27 and 31 pounds of paper for recycling or garbage is $62.47\%$.

### Example 2
The American Automobile Association reports that the average time it takes to respond to an emergency call is 25 minutes. Assume the variable is approximately normally distributed and the standard deviation is 4.5 minutes. If 80 calls are randomly selected, approximately how many will be responded to in less than 15 minutes?

### Solution
This problem does not specifically ask for the probability or the percentage; however, we can use the probability that a call is responded to in less than 15 minutes to answer how many calls will be responded to in less than 15 minutes.

Response time has a mean of $\mu=25$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma=4.5$; therefore, we have a non-standard normal distribution (mean is not 0 and standard deviation is not 1). We can write the probability problem as:

$P(X<15)=~?$

Non-standard to standard normal distribution:
$$Z=\frac{{X-\mu}}{\sigma}=\frac{{15-25}}{4.5}=-2.22$$

$P(X<15)=P(Z<-2.22)$

Table A.3 gives us the area to the left of $=-2.22$ as $0.0132$

Therefore, $1.32\%$ of emergency calls will be responded to in less than 15 minutes.

Now we can use this to answer the question “If 80 calls are randomly selected, approximately how many will be responded to in less than 15 minutes?” by finding $1.32\%$ of $80$.
$$0.0132(80)=1.056$$
Approximately $1$ call will be responded to in under 15 minutes.
