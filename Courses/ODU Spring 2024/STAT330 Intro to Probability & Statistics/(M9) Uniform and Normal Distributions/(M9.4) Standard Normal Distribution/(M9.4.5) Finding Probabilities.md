Remember, the area under the standard normal distribution curve corresponds to probabilities. Therefore, finding the are to the left is equivalent to finding that probability that a variable is **less than** some value because values to the left are smaller than the limit.
$$P(Z<a) =~area~left~of~a$$

Finding the area to right is equivalent to finding the probability that a variable is **greater than** some value because values to the right are larger than the limit.

$$P(Z>b)=~area~right~of~b$$

Finding the area between 2 $Z$-values is equivalent to finding the probability that a variable is in between 2 $Z$-values.

$$P(a<Z<b)=~area~between~a~and~b$$

### Example 1
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZWd56VlN7w) is a useful video on finding probabilities for a standard normal distribution using a table similar to our Table A.3

How can we find $P(Z<-1.32)$?

The $<$ sign indicates our value should be less than 1 and we should be looking to the left of $-1.32$. This means our graph should look something like:

![[finding_normal_distribution_probabilities_example_1.png]]

Then, if we take a look at [[Table A3 - Areas under the Normal Curve.pdf]] for the value $-1.32$, we should find $.0934$

Therefore $P(Z<-1.32)=.0934$. This value corresponds to the area that was shaded in the reddish color.

### Example 2
How about finding $P(Z>-1.32)$

Here, we need to shade to the right. We aren't able to use the table as is, but as we saw earlier, we can do $1-.0934$ to find the complement. This gives us a value of $.9066$.

### Example 3
Lastly, we may be tasked to find $P(-0.21<Z<0.85)$.

Now, we need to find the area between the two $Z$-values. Here's how our curve should look:

![[finding_normal_distribution_probabilities_example_3 1.png]]

We need to look up two things on Table A.3: $-0.21$ and $0.85$:
$-0.21$ gives us $.4168$ 
$0.85$ gives us $.8023$

To find the area in between, we just have to take the difference:
$.8023-.4168 = 0.3855$
