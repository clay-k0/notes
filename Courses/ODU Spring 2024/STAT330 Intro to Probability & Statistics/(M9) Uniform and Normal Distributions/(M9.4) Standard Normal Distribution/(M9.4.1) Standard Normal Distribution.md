### Standard Normal Distribution
The **standard normal distribution** is a particular normal distribution curve that has a mean of 0 ($\mu = 0$) and a standard deviation of 1 ($\sigma = 1$)

A standard normal distribution is always denoted by the letter $Z$. If $Z$ is used in a problem, you can assume the distribution is a standard normal.

### Table A.3
In Table A.3, we are shown the area under a standard normal curve to the left of any positive integer or negative limit $c$.

![[table_a3_area_standard_normal.png]]

The full table can be found [[Courses/ODU Spring 2024/STAT330 Intro to Probability & Statistics/(M10) Normal Applications and Other Continuous Distributions/(M10.2) Central Limit Theorem/Resources/Table A3.pdf|here]] or can be viewed below
![[Table A3 - Areas under the Normal Curve.pdf]]

The first column gives the **ones** and **tenths** value for a limit and the top row gives the **hundredths** value for a limit.

#### Using Table A.3
1. It is designed ONLY for the **standard** normal distribution, which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
2. It is on two pages, one page for **negative** $Z$-scores and the other page for **positive** $Z$-scores.
3. Each value in the body of the table is a cumulative area from the left up to a vertical boundary for a specific $Z$-scores.
4. When working with a graph, avoid confusion between $Z$-scores and areas.
	- $Z$-**scores** are distances along the horizontal axis of the standard normal distribution and are found in the **leftmost column** and **top row** of Table A.3.
	- **Areas** are regions under the density curve and refer to values in the **body** of Table A.3.
