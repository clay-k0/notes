Let’s look at a couple of examples where we are not given an area to the left.

Table A.3: [[Table A3 - Areas under the Normal Curve.pdf]]

### Example 4
Find the $Z$-value that separates the top 20% of the standard normal distribution.

### Solution
Draw the standard normal distribution curve and a vertical line to represent the unknown $Z$-value. Then, shade the area that corresponds to the top 20%.

Notice that we placed the unknown $Z$-value to the left of 0 because the top $20\%=0.20$ is an area to the right. We now need to find the corresponding area to the left for this area to the right. Remember, areas to the left and right of a $Z$-value are complementary events; therefore, the area to the left is 1 minus the area to the right. For this problem, we have $1-0.20=0.80=0.8000$.

Search inside the body of Table A.3 for the closest value we can find to $0.8000$

We find $0.7995$ and $0.8023$. The table value $0.7995$ is $0.0005$ away from $0.8000$ while the table value $0.8023$ is $0.0023$ away from $0.8000$. Therefore, $0.7995$ is closer, our answer is the $Z$-value associated with $0.7995$.

We find that $0.7995$ is in the $0.8$ row and $.04$ column.

Therefore, the $Z$-value is $0.84$.

### Example 5   
Find the value $b$ such that $P(-b<Z<b)=0.98$

### Solution
Draw the standard normal distribution curve and vertical lines to represent $-b$ and $b$. Then, shade the area that corresponds to $0.98$.

Let's use the word tails to describe the _left and right tails_ of the distribution.

We know the entire area under the standard normal distribution curve is 1; therefore, 1 minus the area in the middle is equal to the area in the _tails_. In Example 5, we have $1-0.98=0.02$. Next, we need to find the area in each individual tail. We know the standard normal distribution is symmetric which means each tail is equal; therefore, we can take the area in both tails and divide it by 2. Here, we have $0.02/2=0.01=0.0100$.

![[finding_z_values_5_curve_2.png]]

The area in the _left tail_ is an area to the left. Search inside the body of Table A.3 for the closest value we can find to $0.0100$.

We find $0.0099$ and $0.0102$. The table value $0.0099$ is $0.0001$ away from $0.0100$ while the table value $0.0102$ is $0.0002$ away from $0.0100$. Therefore, $0.0099$ is closer, $-b$ is the $Z$-value associated with $0.0099$.

We find that $0.0099$ is in the $−2.3$ row and $.03$ column.

Therefore, $−b=−2.33$. Using symmetry or simple algebra we then can find that $b=2.33$

### Example 6
Find the $Z$-value given $P(Z<~?)=0.0250$

### Solution
Because of the how small $0.0250$ is, we know we're going to have to find a negative $Z$-score.

After looking in Table A.3 for the value closest match to $0.0250$, we find an exact match, giving us the $Z$-value $-1.96$

Thus, $P(Z<-1.96)=0.0250$

- - -
### Example 7
Find the $Z$-value given $P(Z<~?)=0.9292$

### Solution
This time we notice how large $0.9292$ is; we are going to look for a positive $Z$-value.

After searching for $0.9292$ in Table A.3, we find another exact match, giving us $1.47$ for our $Z$-value.

Thus, $P(Z<1.47)=0.9292$

- - -
### Example 8
Find the $Z$-value given $P(Z>~?)=0.2389$

### Solution
Notice here we have a greater than symbol, meaning we are going to shade to the right. Due to the size of $0.2389$ in comparison to half $0.5$, we'll see that we need to find a positive $Z$-value.

Now we need to find the complement, $1-0.2389 = .7611$.

After searching through the body of Table A.3 for $.7611$, we find an exact match with $0.71$ being our $Z$-value.

Therefore, $P(Z>0.71)=0.2389$

- - -
### Example 9
Find the $Z$-value given $P(Z>~?)=0.8238$

### Solution
In this example, we see we'll be shading to the right (because of $>$) and we notice $.8238$ is larger than half. Thus, we need to find a negative $Z$-value that should be larger than half.

Let's take our complement again: $1-0.8238=0.1762$

Table A.3 has an exact match of the $Z$-value $-0.93$.

Therefore, $P(Z>-0.93)=0.8238$
