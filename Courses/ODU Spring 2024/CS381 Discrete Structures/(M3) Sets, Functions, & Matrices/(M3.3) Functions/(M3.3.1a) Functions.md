### Functions
**Definition:** A **function** $f$ from any set $A$ to set $B$:
- is denoted as $f:A\to B$
- is an assignment of each element of $A$ to **exactly one** element of $B$

> [!Note]
> - We write $f(a)=b$ if $b$ is the unique element of $B$ assigned by the function $f$ to the element $f$ to  element $a$ of $A$
> - Functions are sometimes called **mappings** or **transformations**

##### Examples: 
function $f$ maps students names to letter grades.

**Valid:**

![[functions.png]] 

![[functions2.png]]
- Even though nobody is mapped to grade F, this is still a **valid** function.

![[functions3.png]]
- Here we have two students mapped to grade A. This is still **valid**.

**Invalid:**
![[functions4.png]]
- There is an student (element) that is not mapped to any grade, meaning this is **not** a function.

> [!Note]
> A function $f:A \to B$ can also be fined as a subset of $A \times B$ (a *relation*). This subset is restricted to be a relation where no two elements of the relation have the same first element.

Specifically, a function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ contains one, and only one ordered pair $(a, b)$ for every element of $a \in A$.

- There is a student mapped to two grades. This is **not** a function.

### Functions (cont.)
**Given a function:** $f: A \to B$

- We say $f$ maps $A$ to $B$ or $f$ is mapping from $A$ to $B$
- $A$ is called the **domain** of $f$
- $B$ is called the **codomain** of $f$
- If $f(a) = b$
	- $b$ is called the **image** of $a$ under $f$
	- $a$ is called the **pre-image** of $b$

The **range** of a function $f$ is the **set of all images** of points $A$ under $f$. It is important to understand that the **range does not have to include all elements from the *codomain***.

**Example**
![[functions6.png]]
**Domain (A):** {Rodriguez, Sandeep, Williams, Scott}
**Codomain (B)**: {A, B, C, D, **F**}
**Range**: {A, B, C, D} *The range is always a subset of the codomain*

#### Functions Equality

**Two** functions $f$ and $g$ are **equal** when they have:
- The same **domain**
- The same **codomain**
- **Map each element** of the domain to the same element of the **codomain**

### Representing Functions
Functions may be specified in different ways, including:
1. An explicit statement of the assignment  (*i.e., the students and grades example*)
2. A formula, like $f(x) = x + 1$
3. A computer program 
	- i.e., a Rust program that when given an integer $n$, produces the $nth$ Fibonacci Number

### Important Concepts
**Three important terms:**
1. **Injections** (one-to-one)
2. **Surjections** (onto)
3. **Bijections**

### Injections
**Definition**: A function $f$ is said to be **one-to-one**, or **injective**, if and only if $f(a)=f(b)$ implies that $a=b$ for all $a$ and $b$ in the domain. If for any two samples $a$ and $b$ chosen from the **domain**, the following relation is true:
$$f(a) = f(b) \to a = b$$
We can also represent this as:
$$\forall a \forall b (f(a) = f(b) \to a =b) \equiv \forall a \forall b (a \neq b \to f(a) \neq f(b))$$

As long as we have a valid function, and each $a$ only points to one respective $b$, the function is **injective**.
##### Example 1:
**One-to-one injective** function
![[injection_function.png]]
Here, each sample in our domain maps to one respective sample in our codomain, making this **injective**.
##### Example 2:
**One-to-one injective** function
![[injection_function2.png]]
Even though we have an unmapped sample in our codomain, this function is still an **injective**.

##### Example 3:
***NOT* a one-to-one injective** function
![[injection_function3.png]]
This is a valid function. However, two elements in $A$ point to z, so this is **not** a one-to-one function

### Surjections
**Definition:** A function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is called **onto** or **surjective**, if and only if for every element $b$ from the codomain, there is an element $a$ from the domain such that
$$f(a) = b$$
In other words,
- Every element from the codomain is an image
- Range = Codomain (**every element from $B$ must be used**)

##### Example 1:
**onto (surjective) function** from $A$ to $B$
![[surjective_function.png]]
Every element from $B$ is used, so this is a **surjective** function.

##### Example 2:
**onto (surjective)** function from $A$ to $B$
![[surjective_function2.png]]
Once again, we have a valid function where the range = codomain, meaning this is **onto**.

##### Example 3:
***NOT* an onto (surjective)** function
![[surjective_function3.png]]
While this is a valid function, we have an unused sample in our codomain, so this is **not** a surjective function.

### Bijections
**Definition:** A function $f$ is a **one-to-one correspondence**, or **bijection**, if it is both **one-to-one** AND **onto** (injective and surjective).
