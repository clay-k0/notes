**Example 1**: Can we tile the standard checkerboard using dominos?

**Solution:** Yes! One example provides a **constructive existence proof**

### Tilings
**Example 2**: Can we tile a checkerboard obtained by removing one of the four corner squares of a standard checkerboard?

**Solution:**
- Our new checkerboard has $64-1=63$ squares
- Since each piece of domino has two squares, and to cover a board using domino pieces we must use an even number of squares in the board
- The number 63 is not even
- So, we have a **contradiction**


**Example 3:** Can we tile a board obtained by removing both the upper left and the lower right squares of a standard checkerboard?

**Solution:**
- There are 62 squares in this board
- We need 31 dominos to tile it
- **Note:** Each domino covers **one black** and **one white** square
- Therefore, the tiling covers 31 black squares and 31 white squares
- Our board has either 30 black squares and 32 white squares or 32 black squares and 30 white squares
- Thus, we have a **contradiction**
