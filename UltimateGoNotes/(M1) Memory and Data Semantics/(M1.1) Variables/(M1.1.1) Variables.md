## Variables

### Understanding Type

When it comes to variables in Go, the idea of _type_ is key. 

It represents 2 things:

1. The amount of memory we read and write to
2. What the memory represents

### Types in Go

There are 3 main classes of types in Go:

1. Built-in types (like `int`, `string`, and `bool`)
2. Reference types (like slices and maps)
3. User-defined types (typically a `struct` created by the programmer)

### Declaring Variables

#### Using `var`

Declare a variable with its type to initialize it to the zero value of that type:

```Go
var name    string  // ""
var age     int     // 0
var weight  float64 // 0.0
var isHappy bool    // false
```

#### Using Short Variable Declaration

For initializing variables with specific values, use `:=`, the short variable declaration operator.

```Go
name := "Tom"
age := 25
weight := 150.67
isHappy := true
```

### Numeric Types and Memory

With types like `float64`, itâ€™s clear we're dealing with a 64-bit floating-point number. Numeric types in Go can vary in size:

- `float32` or `float64`: Specifies the precision of floating point numbers.
- `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`: Integer types with varying bit sizes.

Most of the time, we'll be better off letting the compiler figure out what the appropriate type is. When we let the compiler do so, it chooses the most efficient option based on the machine's architecture. For instance, on a 32-bit system, an `int` will be an `int32` under the hood.

### Type Conversions

By prefixing a value with a type, we can convert it:

```go
intToFloat := float32(5) // Converts 5 to 5.0
```
