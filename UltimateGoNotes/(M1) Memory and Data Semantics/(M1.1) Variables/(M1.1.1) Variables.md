## Variables

### What is Type?

When it comes to variables in Go, the idea of _type_ is key. 

It represents 2 things:

1. The amount of memory we read and write to
2. What the memory represents

### Types in Go

There are 3 main classes of types in Go:

1. Built-in types
2. Reference types
3. User-defined types (`struct`)

### Creating Variables

We'll use `var` when we want to declare a variable to its zero value:

```Go
	var name    string  // ""
	var age     int     // 0
	var weight  float64 // 0.0
	var isHappy bool    // false
```

Otherwise, we'll use the short variable declaration operator, `:=`:

```Go
	name := "Tom"
	age := 25
	weight := 150.67
	isHappy := true
```

Notice `float64` is the only type present that tells us both of type's key points. It specifically says we want to create a 64-bit or 8-byte floating-point value. This can only be done with numeric types.

While a `float` can only be 32-bit or 64-bits, an `int` can be 8, 16, 32, or 64-bits.

There will be times where it will be _obvious_ to use types like these, and there will be times when they're _not_ worth using. Most of the time, we'll be better off letting the compiler figure out what the appropriate type is.

When we let the compiler do so, it chooses the most efficient option based on the machine's architecture. For instance, on a 32-bit system, an `int` will be an `int32` under the hood.

### Type Conversions

By prefixing a value with a type, we can convert it:

```go
intToFloat := float32(5) // 5.0
```
