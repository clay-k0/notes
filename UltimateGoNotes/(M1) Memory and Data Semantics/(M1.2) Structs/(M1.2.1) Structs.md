## Structs

We mentioned Go has 3 types: built-in, reference, and user-defined. Here, we'll look at the user defined type, `struct`.

They look like:

```Go
type car struct {
	color string
	make string
	model string
	year int
}
```

Our `car` type be either declared to its zero value, a struct literal, or an empty literal:

**Zero Value**

```Go
var myCar car
```

**Struct Literal**

```Go
myCar := car {
	color: "White",
	make: "Toyota",
	model: "Camry",
	year: 2024,
}
```

**Empty Literal**

We should _only_ use this to construct in a `return` or in a function call.

```Go
myCar := car{}
```

We can access the fields of `myCar` by doing:

```Go
fmt.Printf("My %d %s %s is %s", myCar.year, myCar.make, myCar.model, myCar.color)
```

The `struct` type is referred to as a _composite_ it type because it contains fields that have different types.

### Structs in Memory

Within memory, the size of a struct is affected by

- **Alignment**: Data types in structs are aligned to memory addresses that are multiples of their sizes to ensure efficient memory access by the CPU.

- **Padding**: Padding is added between fields to meet alignment requirements. This may result in extra unused bytes between fields or at the end of a struct.
