## Pointers: Stack Growth

It's possible to completely fill up a stack with a bunch of value semantic function calls (goroutines). 
- Go's compiler will grow the stack using a newly allocated _contiguous_ stack.
- Values on the old stack get _moved_ to the new one

Depending on how small the contiguous stack is, it can present drawbacks since no goroutine can share a value with another goroutine in its stack

This is a situation where _pointer semantics should be favored over value semantics_.
