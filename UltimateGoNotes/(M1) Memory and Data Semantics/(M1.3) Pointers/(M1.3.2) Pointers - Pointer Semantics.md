## Pointers: Pointer Semantics

Let's observe a similar piece of code that makes use of pointer semantics instead of value semantics:

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	count := 10

	fmt.Printf("count has value %d and is located at %v\n", count, &count)
	
	increment(&count)
	
	fmt.Printf("count has value %d and is located at %v\n", count, &count)
}

func increment(num *int) {
	*num++
	fmt.Printf("num has value %d and is located at %v and points to %d\n", num, &num, *num)
}
```

### What Changed?

Before we look at the stack, what exactly changed here?

1. `increment` now accepts `*int`, an _address_ to an `int`.
2. Within the function, we increment the _value_ at this address by dereferencing it using `*` in `*num++` (we also do some small printing to show the value it points to)

### The Stack

Let's again take a look at the stack looks as we move through the program:

| `main` |     | $\leftarrow$ Goroutine |
| ------ | --- | ---------------------- |

| `main` | `count` 10 | $\leftarrow$ Goroutine |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------------- |

| `main`      | `count` 10                           |                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `increment` | `num` * $\uparrow$  (ptr to `count`) | $\leftarrow$ Goroutine |

This is where potential _side-effects_ can be induced as we are modifying data outside the current frame of the goroutine.

| `main`      | `count` 11                           |                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `increment` | `num` * $\uparrow$  (ptr to `count`) | $\leftarrow$ Goroutine |

| `main`      | `count` 11                           | $\leftarrow$ Goroutine |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `increment` | `num` * $\uparrow$  (ptr to `count`) |                        |

### What Does This Mean?

These pointer semantics mean that our goroutines can have shared access to data outside their frame.

### Program Output

This time, the program outputs

```sh
count has value 10 and is located at 0x14000110018
num has value 1374390648856 and is located at 0x14000116020 and points to 11
count has value 11 and is located at 0x14000110018
```

### Value vs. Pointer Semantics

Now, we know that value semantics refer to copying data throughout program boundaries, and pointer semantics refer to sharing access to data throughout program boundaries.

We should mostly use value semantics when possible and use pointer semantics when value semantics aren't appropriate.
