## Pointers: Escape Analysis

Let's see another piece of code that uses both value and pointer semantics:

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

type user struct {
	name  string
	email string
}

func main() {
	userV1 := createUserV1()
	userV2 := createUserV2()

	fmt.Printf("from main | userV1: %v\n", &userV1)
	fmt.Printf("from main | userV2: %v\n", &userV2)
}

// value semantic factory function
func createUserV1() user {
	u := user{
		name: "Clay",
		email: "Clay@email.com",
	}
	fmt.Printf("from V1 | u: %v\n", &u)

	return u
}

// pointer semantic construction function
func createUserV2() *user {
	u := user{
		name: "Clay",
		email: "Clay@email.com",
	}
	fmt.Printf("from V2 | u: %v\n", &u)

	return &u
}
```

The Go compiler performs what is called _static code analysis_. We'll specifically look at _escape analysis_, which tries to read our code a compile time to determine where a value should be constructed in memory, whether on the stack or the heap. 

When a value is on the heap, it is considered an _escape_.

When we `return &u`, we share the value up the stack, meaning it can only be constructed on the heap.
