## Embedding

In Go, you can embed one struct inside another. This setup lets you directly use the methods and properties of the inner struct when you're working with the outer struct. Unlike inheritance in some other languages, Go uses a composition approach to achieve this. This means you're essentially building up complex structures from simpler ones, which allows for more flexibility and clear relationships between different parts of your code.

### Example 1

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// user defines a user in the program
type user struct {
	name  string
	email string
}

// notify the user of the an event
func (u *user) notify() {
	fmt.Printf("sending user email to %s<%s>\n", u.name, u.email)
}

// admin represents an admin user with priveleges
type admin struct {
	// person user -> NOT embedding
	user
	level string
}

func main() {
	// create an admin user
	ad := admin{
		user: user{
			name:  "clay",
			email: "clay@email.com",
		},
		level: "super",
	}

	// we can access the inner type's method directly
	ad.user.notify()

	// the inner type's method is promoted
	ad.notify()
}
```

#### Output

```sh
sending user email to clay<clay@email.com>
sending user email to clay<clay@email.com>
```

Here, the `admin` struct is embedded within the `user` struct, which allows the `admin` to access the `user`'s methods and fields directly.

_Inner Type Promotion:_ The `notify` method of `user` is accessible directly on an `admin` instance, shown as `ad.notify()`. This is a result of Go's promotion mechanism where methods of the embedded type (`user`) become part of the embedding type (`admin`).

Note that `admin` is _not_ a `user`, but it has access to its methods and properties. Also, the embedded type can be accessed explicitly using `ad.user.notify()`.

### Example 2

What if we add our `notifier` interface and the `sendNotification` function back?

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// notifier defines notification type behavior
type notifier interface{
	notify()
}

// user defines a user in the program
type user struct {
	name  string
	email string
}

// notify the user of the an event
func (u *user) notify() {
	fmt.Printf("sending user email to %s<%s>\n", u.name, u.email)
}

// admin represents an admin user with priveleges
type admin struct {
	user
	level string
}

func main() {
	// create an admin user
	ad := admin{
		user: user{
			name:  "clay",
			email: "clay@email.com",
		},
		level: "super",
	}

	// send the admin user a notification when
	// the embedded inner type's implementation is 
	// promoted to the outer type
	sendNotification(&ad)
}

// sendNotification takes a value that implements 
// notifier, then sends notifications
func sendNotification(n notifier) {
	n.notify()
}
```

#### Output

```sh
sending user email to clay<clay@email.com>
```

We know `user` implements the `notifier` interface using pointer semantics, but what about `admin`? Well, because we embedded it, it also implements `notifier`. This is another instance of inner type promotion. 

We passed `sendNotification` an address of an `admin` because `user` implements `notifier` using a pointer receiver.

### Example 3

In this example, `admin` has its own `notify` method, which shadows the `notify` method from the embedded `user`.

_Method Shadowing:_ When both the outer type (`admin`) and the inner type (`user`) have methods of the same name, the outer type's method takes precedence.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// notifier defines notification type behavior
type notifier interface{
	notify()
}

// user defines a user in the program
type user struct {
	name  string
	email string
}

// notify users of an event
func (u *user) notify() {
	fmt.Printf("Sending user email to %s<%s>\n", u.name, u.email)
}

// admin represents an admin user with priveleges
type admin struct {
	user
	level string
}

// notify admins of an event
func (a *admin) notify() {
	fmt.Printf("Sending admin email to %s<%s>\n", a.name, a.email)
}

func main() {
// create an admin user
	ad := admin{
		user: user{
			name:  "clay",
			email: "clay@email.com",
		},
		level: "super",
	}

	// send the admin user a notification when
	// the embedded inner type's implementation is 
	// NOT promoted to the outer type
	sendNotification(&ad)

	// we can access the inner type's method directly
	ad.user.notify()

	// the inner type's method is NOT promoted
	ad.notify()
}

// sendNotification takes a value that implements 
// notifier, then sends notifications
func sendNotification(n notifier) {
	n.notify()
}
```

#### Output

```sh
Sending admin email to clay<clay@email.com>
Sending user email to clay<clay@email.com>
Sending admin email to clay<clay@email.com>
```

Despite the `user`'s `notify` method being available, `admin`'s `notify` method is called when using `ad.notify()`.
