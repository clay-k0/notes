## If Performance Matters

We will explore the question "If performance matters, then what matters to me as a Go developer?" throughout this course.

There's 4 reasons why your software isn't running as fast as it could be: 

1. External Latency
- **Definition:** Time, often milliseconds, lost from things like system calls or network waiting times
- **Impact:** Microservices suffer from these when they jump processes to handle a request
- **Focus:** While important, this course will not delve deeply into external latency issues.

2. Internal Latency
- **Definition**: Microseconds lost within the application, typically caused by processes like garbage collection and synchronization in multi-threaded environments.
- **Examples**: Overhead from managing memory or locking mechanisms during concurrency.
- **Focus**: We will explore strategies to minimize internal latency.

3. Handling Data on our Machine
- **Definition**: Performance impacts based on how data is accessed and stored on a machine.
- **Focus**: Effective data handling strategies can significantly enhance performance, and we'll examine the best practices.

4. Algorithm Efficiency
  - These won't really hurt us unless we're in tight loops; Go is very efficient.
