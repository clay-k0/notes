## If Performance Matters

We will explore the question "If performance matters, then what matters to me as a Go developer?" throughout this course.

There's 4 reasons why your software isn't running as fast as it can: 

1. External Latency
  - We aren't going to discuss these much
  - Milliseconds lost from things like syscalls and waiting on things in the network
    - Microservices suffer from these when they jump processes to handle a request

2. Internal Latency
  - Microseconds lost within the internals of our apps, such as the garbage collector and synchronization when dealing with multi-threaded programming

3. Handling Data on our Machine
  - How we access and store data will consequently affect performance

4. Algorithm Efficiency
  - These won't really hurt us unless we're in tight loops; Go is very efficient

We'll learn about how some of these work as we continue.
