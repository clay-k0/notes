[[Table A3 - Areas under the Normal Curve.pdf]]
- - -
Now, that we have learned to find a probability for a standard normal random variable we are going to reverse the process. For this topic, we know the percentage of the distribution we want to cover (top 10%, bottom 25%, middle 50%, etc.) and now we need to find the $Z$ score that defines or separates this region of the curve.
****
### Procedure
1. Draw a bell-shaped curve and identify the region under the curve that corresponds to the given probability or percentage.
2. If the region is not an area to the left. calculate the corresponding area(s) to the left for the unknown $Z$-value(s)
3. Using the area(s) to the left, locate the **closest probability in the body of Table A.3** and identify the corresponding $Z$-score

### Example 1
Find the positive $Z$-value such that the are under the standard normal distribution curve between 0 and the $Z$-value is $0.2123$

### Solution
First, draw the standard normal distribution curve and a vertical line to represent the unknown $Z$-value. Then, shade the area that corresponds to the given probability or area of $0.2123$.

Notice, that we placed the unknown $Z$-value to right of 0 because the problem told us the $Z$-value was positive.

Now, the area given is NOT an area to the left but an area between, therefore we need to find the cumulative area to the left of the unknown $Z$-value. We can use the fact that the area to the left of 0 is $0.5000$ and we can add the two areas together to get $0.5000 + 0.2123 = 0.7123$ the cumulative area to the left of the unknown $Z$-value.

Now that we know the area to the left, we can use Table A.3; however, we are going to use it in reverse. We know the area or probability so we are going to search inside the body of Table A.3 fir the closest value we can find to $0.7123$

![[finding_z_values_table_a3.jpeg]]

We can find that $0.7123$ is in the $0.5$ row and $0.06$ column. The row specifies the ones and tenths place while the column specifies the hundredths value of the $Z$-value.

Therefore, the $Z$-value is $0.56$.


**Note:** In this first example, we were able to find the exactly value of $0.7123$ inside Table A.3; however, you are not always able to do so. Sometimes we have to find the closest value.

### Example 2
Find the $Z$-value that separates the bottom $15\%$ of the standard normal distribution.

### Solution
Draw the standard normal distribution curve and a vertical line to represent the unknown $Z$-value. Then, shade the area that corresponds to the bottom $15\%$

![[finding_z_values_2_curve.png]]

Notice that we placed the unknown $Z$-value to the left of 0 because the bottom $15\%=0.15=0.1500$ is a small area to the left. Also, the given percentage is already an area to the left, so we are ready to use Table A.3.

Search inside the body of Table A.3 for the closest value we can find to $0.1500$

![[finding_z_values_2_table_a3.jpeg]]

We find $0.1492$ and $0.1515$. The table value $0.1482$ is $0.0008$ away from $0.1500$ while the value $0.1515$ is $0.0015$ away from $0.1500$. Therefore, $0.1492$ is closer, our answer is the $Z$-value associated with $0.1492$.

We find that $0.1492$ is in the $-1.0$ and $.04$ column.

Therefore, the $Z$-value is $-1.04$

**Note:** In example 2, we were able to find a value inside Table A.3 that was closest to the specified percentage; however, sometimes a specified percentage lies exactly in the middle of two table values. When this occurs, we take the unknown $Z$-value as the average of the two corresponding $Z$-values. Notice we also wrote 0.15 as 0.1500. Values inside Table A.3 have 4 decimal places. To remind ourselves that we are searching inside the body of Table A.3, we can always write areas/probabilities using 4 decimal places by padding additional zeros.

### Example 3
Find the $Z$-value $a$ such that $P(Z<a)=95\%$

### Answer
Reading from left to right $P(Z<a)=95\%$ states that "the probability that $Z$ is less than $a$ is $95\%$." Here again, we are given the probability or percentage and need to find the unknown value $a$.

Draw the standard normal distribution curve and a vertical line to represent the unknown $Z$-value. Then, shade the area that corresponds to the $95\%=0.95=0.9500$

![[finding_z_values_3_curve.png]]

Notice we placed the unknown $Z-value$, $a$, to the right of 0 because less than is an area to the left and the area to the left is larger than half of the distribution. The given percentage is already an area to the left, so we are ready to use Table A.3.

Search inside the body of Table A.3 for the closest value we can find to $0.9500$

![[finding_z_values_3_table_a3.jpeg]]

We find $0.9495$ and $0.9505$. The table value $0.9495$ is $0.0005$ away from $0.9500$ and the table value $0.9505$ is also $0.0005$ away from $0.9500$. Therefore, we cannot choose a closest value to $0.9500$. Instead we average the two $Z$-values.

We see that $0.9495$ is in the $1.6$ row and $.04$ column. Therefore, the $Z$-value for $0.9495$ is $1.64$.

Similarly, $0.9505$ is in the $1.6$ row and $.05$ column. Therefore, the $Z$-value for $0.9505$ is $1.65$.

$$\frac{1.64+1.65}{2}=1.645$$
