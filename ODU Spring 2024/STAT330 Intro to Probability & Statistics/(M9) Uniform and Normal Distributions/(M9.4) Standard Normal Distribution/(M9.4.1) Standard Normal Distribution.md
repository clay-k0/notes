### Standard Normal Distribution
The **standard normal distribution** is a particular normal distribution curve that has a mean of 0 ($\mu = 0$) and a standard deviation of 1 ($\sigma = 1$)

> Z score

A standard normal distribution is always denoted by the letter $Z$. If $Z$ is used in a problem, you can assume the distribution is a standard normal.

### Table A.3
In Table A.3, we are shown the area under a standard normal curve to the left of any positive integer or negative limit $c$.

The full table can be found [here](obsidian://open?vault=ODU%20Spring%202024&file=STAT330%20Intro%20to%20Probability%20%26%20Statistics%2F(M9)%20Uniform%20and%20Normal%20Distributions%2F(M9.4)%20Standard%20Normal%20Distribution%2FResources%2FTable%20A3%20-%20Areas%20under%20the%20Normal%20Curve.pdf) or can be viewed below
![[Table A3 - Areas under the Normal Curve.pdf]]

The first column gives the **ones** and **tenths** value for a limit and the top row gives the **hundredths** value for a limit.

#### Using Table A.3
1. It is designed ONLY for the **standard** normal distribution, which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
2. It is on two pages, one page for **negative** $Z$-scores and the other page for **positive** $Z$-scores.
3. Each value in the body of the table is a cumulative area from the left up to a vertical boundary for a specific $Z$-scores.
4. When working with a graph, avoid confusion between $Z$-scores and areas.
	- $Z$-**scores** are distances along the horizontal axis of the standard normal distribution and are found in the **leftmost column** and **top row** of Table A.3.
	- **Areas** are regions under the density curve and refer to values in the **body** of Table A.3.
