Since. the entire area under the standard normal distribution curve is 1 and a value splits the distribution into two pieces (left and right), then the area to the left and right of a value must sum to 1. Therefore, to find the **area to the right** of any $Z$-value:

Look up the $Z$-value in Table A.3 and subtract the area from 1

### Example
Find the are to the right $Z=-1.16$

![[area_to_right_table_a3_example.jpeg]]

The value in the $-1.1$ row and the $.06$ column of Table A.3 is .1230. 
Thus, the area is $1-.1230=.8770$
