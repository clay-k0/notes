We can use the standard normal distribution to solve problems for any non-standard normal distribution problem (i.e., the mean is not 0 or t he standard deviation is not 1).

**Theorem:** Let $X$ have a normal distribution with mean = $\mu$ and standard deviation = $\sigma$, then $Z$ has a standard normal distribution if 
$$Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$$
**Proof:** 
$$P(Z\leq t)=P(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\leq t)=P(X\leq \mu+\sigma t)$$
$$=\int ^{\mu + \sigma t} _{-\infty}\, \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2\pi \sigma }}e^{\frac{-1}{2}*\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}}dx $$
Integrate by substitution: Let $Z=\frac{{X-\mu}}{\sigma}$
$$\implies x = \mu + \sigma z dx=\sigma dz$$
$$x=\mu+\sigma t \implies z = \frac{(\mu +\sigma t)-\mu}{\sigma}=t$$

$$P(Z\leq t)=\int ^t _{-\infty}\,\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2\pi }}e^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2} \sigma dz $$
= area under a standard normal PDF to the left of $t$

Therefore, to solve a problem for a non-standard normal distribution, we convert from $X$ to $Z$ or $Z$ to $X$. We called this standardizing a random variable earlier in the course; here, we are standardizing a normally distribution random variable.

### Example
A survey found that women spend on average $\$146.21$ on beauty products during the summer months. Assume the standard deviation is $\$29.44$. Find the percentage of women who spend less than $\$160$. Assume the variable is normally distributed.

### Solution
Spending has a mean of $\mu =\$146.21$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma = \$29.44$; therefore, we have a non-standard normal distribution (mean is not 0 and standard deviation is not 1). We can write the problem as:

$P(X<\$160)=?$

Here we use $X$ to represent the non-standard normally distributed random variable.

We need to convert this problem to a standard normal distribution by converting $\$160$ to a $Z$-value.

$$Z=\frac{{X-\mu}}{\sigma}=\frac{160-146.21}{29.44}=0.47$$

Now we have a Standard Normal Distribution problem. Note that we round the $Z$-value to 2 decimal places.

$$P(X<\$160)=P(Z<0.47)=~?$$

Locating $0.47$ in Table A.3 gives us an area to the left of $0.6808$

Therefore, $68.08\%$ of women spend less than $\$160$ on beauty products during the summer months.

**Note:** In this example, we were asked to find the percentage of women. We used our knowledge that a percent is the same as a probability. Key words to identity this type of problem is "Find the percentage" or "Find the probability".
