### Example 1:
In the World Series, the team that wins four games out of seven is the winner. Suppose that the Cubs and Tigers face each other in the series and that the Cubs have a 55% chance of winning a game over the Tigers. Determine the following:
1. What is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series in 4 games?
2. What is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series in 5 games?
3. What is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series in 6 games?
4. What is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series in 7 games?
5. What is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series?

### Solution:
###### Q1: What is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series in 4 games?

$X$ is a negative binomial random variable.
$k=4$                      (4 games to win a 7 game series)
$x=4$                      (we want to win in 4 games)
$p=0.55$                 (probability of cubs winning the entire game)
$q=1-.55=.45$   (probability of cubs losing the entire game)

$$f(x)={x-1 \choose k-1}p^kq^{x-k}={x-1 \choose 4-1}(0.55)^4(0.45)^{x-4}$$
$$f(4)={4-1 \choose 4-1}(0.55)^4(0.45)^{4-4}$$
$$={3 \choose 3}(0.55)^4(0.45)^0= 0.0915$$
Thus, there is a $9.15\%$ chance that the Cubs win in 4 games.

###### Q2: What is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series in 5 games?

$X$ is a negative binomial random variable.
$k=4$           (4 games to win)
$x=5$           (we want to win in 5 games)
$p=0.55$       (probability of cubs winning)
$q=.45$ 

$$f(5)={5-1 \choose 4-1}(0.55^4)(0.45^{5-4})={4 \choose 3}(0.55^4)(0.45^{1})=0.1647$$
Thus, there is a $16.47\%$ chance that the Cubs win in 5 games.

###### Q3: What is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series in 6 games?
$k=4$           
$x=6$          
$p=0.55$      
$q=.45$ 

$$f(6)={6-1 \choose 4-1}(0.55^4)(0.45^{6-4})={5 \choose 3}(0.55^4)(0.45^{2})=0.1853$$
Thus, there is a $18.53\%$ chance that the Cubs win in 6 games.

##### Q4: What is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series in 7 games?
$k=4$           
$x=7$          
$p=0.55$      
$q=.45$ 

$$f(7)={7-1 \choose 4-1}(0.55^4)(0.45^{7-4})={6 \choose 3}(0.55^4)(0.45^{3})=0.1668$$
Thus, there is a $16.68\%$ chance that the Cubs win in 7 games.

##### Q5: What is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series?
$P$(Cubs Win) $= f(4)+f(5)+f(6)+f(7)=0.0915+0.1647+0.1853+0.1668=0.6083$

### Example 2:
If the Cubs and Reds are facing each other in the National League Division Series, which is decided by winning the best of five games, what is the probability that the Cubs would win the series? Assume the probability that the Cubs win a single game against the Reds is 0.70.

### Solution:
$X$ is a negative binomial random variable.
$k=3$                      (3 games to win a 5 game series)
$p=0.70$                 (probability of cubs winning a single game)
$q=1-.70=.30$   (probability of cubs losing a single game)
$x={3,4,5}$               (since this is best of 5, we can win in 3, 4, or 5 games)

$$f(x)={x-1 \choose k-1}p^kq^{x-k}={x-1 \choose 3-1}(0.7^3)(0.3^{x-3})$$
$$f(3)={3-1 \choose 3-1}(0.7^3)(0.3^{3-3})={2 \choose 2}(0.7^3)(0.3^{0})=0.343$$
$$f(4)={4-1 \choose 3-1}(0.7^3)(0.3^{4-3})={3 \choose 2}(0.7^3)(0.3^{1})=0.3087$$
$$f(5)={5-1 \choose 3-1}(0.7^3)(0.3^{5-3})={4 \choose 2}(0.7^3)(0.3^{2})=0.18522$$
$P$(Cubs Win)$=f(3)+f(4)+f(5)=0.343+0.3087+0.18522=0.83692$

Thus, there is a $83.69\%$ chance that the Cubs win against the Reds.
