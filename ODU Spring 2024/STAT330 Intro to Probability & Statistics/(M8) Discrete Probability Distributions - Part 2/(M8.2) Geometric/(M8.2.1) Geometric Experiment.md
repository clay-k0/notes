Consider the special case of the negative binomial distribution where $k=1$, we now have an experiment where the trials will be repeated until a single _Successes_ occurs. In a binomial experiment, we are interested in the probability of $x$ _Successes_ in a fixed number of trials ($n$). In a negative binomial experiment, we are interested in the probability that the $k^{th}$ _Success_ occurs on the $x^{th}$ trial. Now, we are interested in the probability that the $1^{st}$ _Success_ occurs on the $x^{th}$ trial. This type of experiment is called a **geometric experiment**.

A **geometric** **experiment** must satisfy the following requirements:
- The experiment consists of independent and identical (iid) trials.
- Each trial has 2 possible outcomes called _Success_ and _Failure_.
- The per trial probability, $p$, that a _Success_ occurs must remain constant for each trial.
- The main interest of the experiment is to count the number of trials it takes to get to the $1^{st}$ _Success_.

Here we are observing a sequence of Bernoulli trials until a single _Successes_ occurs.
