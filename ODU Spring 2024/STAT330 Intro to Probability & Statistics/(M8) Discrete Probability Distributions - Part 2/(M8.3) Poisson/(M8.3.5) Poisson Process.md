The Poisson process describes events occurring over time or space. Examples:
1. The number of accidents occurring on successive days at a certain intersection
2. The number of flaws occurring in different regions of a metal casting
3. The number of claims in excess of $5,000 submitted to a health insurer over consecutive one-month periods

**Definition:** Let $N(s,t)=$ the number of events occurring in the time interval $(s,t)$ where $x<t$. $N(s,t)$ is a Poisson process with rate parameter $\lambda$ if
1. The number of events occurring in disjoint time intervals are independent random variables
2. The number, $N(s,t)$, of events occurring in a particular time interval, $(s,t)$, has a Poisson distribution with mean $\mu=\lambda(t-s)$.

### Example:
In a certain locality the rate of occurrence of traffic deaths per week is 0.9. Let $X$ be the number of traffic deaths occurring in a certain 3-week period. Assuming $X$ has a Poisson distribution, determine the probability that at most 1 traffic death occurs in a 3-week period.

### Solution:
$\mu = E(X)=0.9(3)=2.7$

That is, on average, there are 2.7 traffic deaths in a 3-week period. Since $\mu = 2.7$,
$$P(X=0)=f(0)=\frac{{2.7^0e^{-2.7}}}{0!}=e^{-2.7}$$
$$P(X=1)=f(1)=\frac{{2.7^1e^{-2.7}}}{1!}=2.7e^{-2.7}$$
$$P(X\leq 1)=f(0)+f(1)=e^{-2.7}+2.7e^{-2.7}=0.2487$$
