Let $X_{i}$ equal to the number of times the outcome $A_{i}$ occurs in $n$ trials for $i=1,2,\dots,k$. The joint probability distribution of $X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{k}$ is
$$f(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{k})=P(X_{1}=x_{1},X_{2}=x_{2},\dots,X_{k}=x_{k})=\frac{n!}{x_{1}!x_{2}!,\dots x_{k}!}p_{1}^{x_{1}}p_{2}^{x_{2}},\dots,p_{k}^{x_{k}}$$
where $x_{i}=0,1,\dots,n;~\sum_{i=1}^k x_{i}=n;~and \sum_{i=1}^k p_{1}=1$

### Properties of the Multinomial Distribution
- The number of times outcome $A_{1}$ occurs $+$ the numbers of times outcome $A_{2}$ occurs $+\dots+$ the number of times outcome $A_{k}$ occurs must equal the sample size. 
	- $x_{1}+x_{2}+\dots+x_{k}=n$
- The sum of the probability of each outcome $A_{1},A_{2},\dots,A_{k}$ must equal 1.
	- $p_{1}+p_{2}+\dots+p_{k}=1$
- The marginal distribution of each $X_{i}$ is a binomial random variable with parameters $n$ and $p_{i}$.
	- $E(X_{i})=np_{i}~and~Var(X_{i})=np_{i}q_{i}$ where
	- $q_{i}=1-p_{i}$
