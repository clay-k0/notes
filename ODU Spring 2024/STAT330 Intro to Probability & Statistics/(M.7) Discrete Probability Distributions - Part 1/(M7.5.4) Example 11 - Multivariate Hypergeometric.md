### Example
In a poker hand consisting of 5 cards, determine the probability of holding
1) 3 aces
2) 1 king and 3 aces
3) $E(X)$ and $Var(X)$ where $X$ is the number of aces obtained in the sample of 5 cards

### Solution
1) This is a hypergeometric problem with 52 cards in a deck, of which 4 are aces and 48 are other cards: 
$$f(3)=\frac{{{4 \choose 3}{48 \choose 2}}}{52 \choose 5}=\frac{94}{54145}=0.17\%$$
2) This is a multivariate hypergeometric problem with 52 cards in a deck, of which 4 are kings, 4 are aces, and 44 are other cards
$$f(1,3,1)=\frac{{{4 \choose 1}{4 \choose 3}{44 \choose 1}}}{52 \choose 5}=\frac{44}{162435}=0.03\%$$
3) $p_{1}=\frac{N_{1}}{N}=\frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{13}$
	$E(X_{1})=np_{1}=(5)\left( \frac{1}{13} \right)=0.385$
	$Var(X_{1})=\frac{{N-n}}{N-1}np_{i}q_{i}=\frac{{52-5}}{52-1}(5)\left( \frac{1}{13} \right)\left( 1-\frac{1}{13} \right)=0.327$
