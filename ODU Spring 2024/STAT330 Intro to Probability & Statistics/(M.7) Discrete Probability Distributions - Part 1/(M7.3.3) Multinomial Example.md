### Example
In a certain population of manufactured items, 70% have zero defects, 20% have one defect, and 10% have two defects. Suppose 5 items are selected at random from this population.

Let
$X_{1}=$ # of items in the sample that have 0 defects
$X_{2}=$ # of items in the sample that have 1 defects
$X_{3}=$ # of items in the sample that have 2 defects

Find of identify the following:
a) The values of $n,p_1,p_2,~and~p_3$ 
b) $P(X_{1}=4,X_{2}=1,X_{3}=0)$
c) $P(X_{1}=4,X_{2}=1)$
d) $P(X_{1}=4)$
e) $E(X_{i},~i=1,2,3)$

#### Solution: 
a) $n=5$
$p_{1}=70\%=0.7$
$p_{2}=20\%=0.2$
$p_{3}=10\%=0.1$
$f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=\frac{n!}{x_{1}!x_{2}!x_{3}!}p_{1}^{x_{1}}p_{2}^{x_{2}}p_{3}^{x_{3}} = \frac{5!}{x_{1}!x_{2}!x_{3}!}(0.7)^{x_{1}}(0.2)^{x_{2}}(0.1)^{x_{3}}$

b) $P(X_{1}=4,X_{2}=1,X_{3}=0) = f(4,1,0)$
$f(4,1,0)=\frac{5!}{4!1!0!}(0.7)^4(0.2)^1(0.1)^0=0.2401$

c) $P(X_{1}=4,X_{2}=1)$
Note that there are 4 items with 0 defects and 1 item with 1 defect. Therefore, there are no items with 2 defects in the sample because the sample size, $n$, is 5. A requirement of the multinomial distribution is that $X_{1}+X_{2}+X_{3}=n$. Thus,
$4+1+x_{3}=5\to x_{3}=0$
Meaning, $P(X_{1}=4,X_{2}=1)=P(X_{1}=4,X_{2}=1,X_{3}=0)=0.2401$ from part a

d) $P(X_{1}=4)$
$X_{i}$ is a binomial random variable with $n=5$ and $p=p_{1}=0.7$

e) $E(X_{1})=np_{1}=(5)(0.7)=3.5$
$E(X_{2})=np_{2}=(5)(0.2)=1$
$E(X_{3})=np_{3}=(5)(0.1)=.5$

**Note:** $E(X_{1})+E(X_{2})+E(X_{3})=5=n$. The experiment has a sample size of 5, so 5 items are expected total. The expected values for each binomial tell us how many of each type are expected to occur in the sample.
