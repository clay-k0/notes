The multivariate hypergeometric distribution is the multivariate extension of the hypergeometric distribution. In multivariate hypergeometric experiments, the population contains more than two types of items, and, like the hypergeometric distribution, items are selected from the population, without replacement.

A **multivariate hypergeometric experiment** must satisfy the following requirements:
- A sample size of size $n$ is selected without replacement from a population of $N$ objects.
- The population contains $k$ types of objects, denoted by $A_{1},A_{2},\dots,A_{k}$. $N_{i}$ is equal to the number of objects of type $A_{i}$ in the population.
- The main interest of the experiment is the random variables $X_{i}$ equal to the number of objects of type $A_{i}$ in the sample for $i=1,2,\dots k$.
