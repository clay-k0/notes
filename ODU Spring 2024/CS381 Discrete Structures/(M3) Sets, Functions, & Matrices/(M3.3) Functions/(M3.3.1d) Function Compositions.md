## Composition
**Definition:** Let $f: B\to C, ~g:A \to B$. The **composition** of $f$ with $g$, denoted by $f \circ g$ is the function from $A$ to $C$ defined by $f \circ g(x)=f(g(x))$

### Examples

**Example 1**: 
If $f(x)=x^2$ and $g(x)=2x+1$, find the composition:

**Solution**
$f \circ g= f(g(x))=(2x+1)^2$
and
$g \circ f =g(f(x))= 2x^2+1$

The relation between $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$ is $\neq$

**Example 2**: 
Let $g$ be the function from the set $\{a,b,c\}$ to itself such that $g(a)=b,~g(b)=c$, and $g(c)=a$ 

Let $f$ be the function from the set $\{a,b,c\}$ to the set $\{1,2,3\}$ such that $f(a)=3,~f(b)=2$, and $f(c)=1$

**Solution**

$f \circ g(a)=f(g(a))=f(b)=2$
$f \circ g(b)=f(g(b))=f(c)=1$
$f \circ g(c)=f(g(c))=f(a)=3$

$g \circ f$ is **not defined** because the range of $f$ is not a subset of the domain $g$.

**Example 3**:
Let $f$ and $g$ be the functions from the set of integers to the set of integers defined by
$f(x)=2x+3$ and $g(x)=3x+2$

What is the composition of $f$ and $g$ as well as $g$ and $f$

**Solution:**

$f \circ g(x)=f(3x+2)=2(3x+2)+3=6x+7$
$g \circ f(x) =g(2x+3)=3(2x+3)+2=6x+11$
