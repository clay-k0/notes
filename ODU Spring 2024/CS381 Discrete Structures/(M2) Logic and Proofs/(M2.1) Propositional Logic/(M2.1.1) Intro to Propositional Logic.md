### **Proposition / Claim**

**Definition**: 
* A ***proposition*** (claim) is a ***declarative*** sentence that is either ***true*** or ***false*** (but not both)
	* They ***CANNOT*** be half true, half false, almost true, or almost false.

Thus, the person who makes the **proposition/claim** will be sharing <u>clear</u> and <u>precise</u> understanding with the audience of said **claim**.

**Examples**
The following <u>ARE</u> examples of **propositions**:
* The moon is made of green cheese.   (false)
* Richmond is the capitol of Virginia.     (true)
* 1 + 0 = 1                                                 (true)
* 0 + 0 = 2                                                (false)

The following are <u>NOT</u> examples of **propositions**:
* What time is it?                                     (question)
* Sit down and close the door, ...           (command/request for action)
* Wonderful!, Great!, Amazing!               (exclamation)
* x + 1 = 2                                                 (contains a variable; what is x?)
* This box is so heavy                             (subjectivity; what defines heavy?)

### Propositional Logic

#### **Constructing Propositions**
1. Propositional Variables: *p*, *q*, *r*, *s*, ... (small italic letters)
2. Examples :
	* *p* = Today is my Birthday
	* *q* = The sky is blue
	* *r* = New York is the capitol of the US
3. A <u>true</u> proposition is denoted by <u>T</u> , while <u>false</u> propositions are denoted by <u>F</u>.
4. **Simple** vs **Compound** Propositions
	* <u>Simple</u> propositions includes a single propositional variable (*p*) 
	* <u>Compound</u> propositions are constructed from a **set** of propositions - *connected with **logical connectives***
		- **Example**: Today is my Birthday (*p*), ***and*** today is Monday (*q*)


#### Logical Connectives
1. **Negation** (¬)
	* The **negation** of proposition *p* can be represented by ¬*p* and has a truth table like:
	   *p*           |         ¬*p*
	   -----------------
	   T           |          F
	   F           |          T     

	  **Example**: 
	  * If *p* denotes "The Earth is round," then
	  * ¬*p* denotes "It is **not** the case that the Earth is round," or "The Earth is **not** round"
2. **Conjunction** (∧, and)
	* The **conjunction** of propositions *p* and *q* can be represented by *p*∧*q* and has a truth table like:
	   *p*           |         *q*          |       *p*∧*q*
	   -----------------------------------
	   T           |          T         |          T
	   T           |          F         |          F
	   F           |          T         |          F
	   F           |          F         |          F
	  **Example**:
	   * If *p* denotes "I am at home" and *q* denotes "It is raining," then
	   * *p*∧*q* denotes "<u>I am at home</u> **and** <u>it is raining</u>"
3. **Disjunction** (∨, or)
	* The **disjunction** of propositions *p* and *q* can be represented by *p*∨*q* and has a truth table like:
	   *p*           |         *q*          |       *p*∨*q*
	   -----------------------------------
	   T           |          T         |          T
	   T           |          F         |          T
	   F           |          T         |          T
	   F           |          F         |          F
	   
	  **Example**:
	   * If *p* denotes "I am at home" and *q* denotes "It is raining," then
	   * *p*∨*q* denotes "<u>I am at home</u> **or** <u>it is raining</u>"
	
	   *Note*: this type of **or** is called the ***inclusive*** **or** because **one true** proposition is sufficient for the statement to be **true**, and when **both** inputs are **true**, the output is **true**.

		***The Connective Or in English***
		Or has two distinct meanings:
		1. **Inclusive** Or:
			* **Example**: "Students who have taken CS202 ***or*** MTH120 may enroll is  this class," either **one** or **both** of *p* and *q* must be **true**
			* We just saw this above
		1. **Exclusive** Or:
			* **Example**: "Dinner comes with soup **or** salad."
			* We do not expect to get both soup and salad
			* Exclusive, XOR, ⊕
			* In p ⊕ q, **one** of *p* and *q* must be true, but **not** both
			* Truth table:
			*p*           |         *q*          |       *p*⊕*q*
		    -----------------------------------
		    T           |          T         |          ***F***
		    T           |          F         |          T
		    F           |          T         |          T
		    F           |          F         |           F
4. **Implication** (-->)
	* Assume *p* and *q* are two propositions
	* *p*-->*q* is a *conditional statement or **implication*** which is read as "if *p*, then *q*," and has a truth table like:
	   *p*           |         *q*          |       *p*-->*q*
	   -----------------------------------
	   T           |          T         |          T
	   T           |          F         |          ***F***             Always true except for this case
	   F           |          T         |          T
	   F           |          F         |          T
	   
	  **Example**:
	   * If *p* denotes "I am at home" and *q* denotes "It is raining," then
	   * *p*-->*q* denotes "**If** <u>I am at home</u>, **then** <u>it is raining</u>"
	   * In *p*-->*q*:
		   * *p* is the ***hypothesis*** (**antecedent/premise**) and
		   * *q* is the ***conclusion*** (**consequence**)
	
		**More Examples:**
		1. **If** I win the election, **then** I will lower taxes.
		2. **If** you eat your dinner, **then** you will play outside.
		3. **If** you get all A's in your classes, **then** I will increase your allowance.

		**Different Ways of Expressing *p*-->*q***:
		* if p, **then** q
		* if p, q
		* q **unless** ¬p
		* q **if** p
		* q **whenever** p
		* q **follows from** p
		* p **implies** q
		* p **only if** q
		* q **when** p
		* p **is sufficient for** q
		* q **is necessary for** p
		* **a necessary condition for** p **is** q
		* **a sufficient condition for** q **is** p

		**Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse**
		* From *p*-->q we can form new conditional statements, like:
			1. *q*-->*p*       is the **converse** of *p*-->*q*
			2. ¬*p*-->¬*q*   is the **inverse** of *p*-->*q*
			3. ¬*q*-->¬*p*   is the **contrapositive** of p-->*q*
			
			Note: the **contrapositive** is equivalent to the **original implication**

			**Example**:
			Find the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of "**It raining** is a sufficient condition for me **not going to town**."

			 *p* = It is raining.
			 *q* = I am not going to town.

			**Converse**: If I am not going to town (*q*), then it is raining (*p*).
			**Inverse**: If it is not raining (¬*p*), then I'm going to town (¬*q*).
			**Contrapositive**: If I am going to town (¬*q*), then it is not raining (¬*p*).
			
		**Truth Table with Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse**
		*p*   |   *q*   |  ¬p  |  ¬q   **|  *p*-->*q*  |   ¬*p*-->¬*q*   |   *q*-->*p*   |  ¬*q*-->¬*p***
	   -----------------------------------------------------------------
	    T   |   T  |   F   |    F   |     T      |         T        |     T       |        T
	    T   |   F  |   F   |    T   |     F      |         T        |     T       |        F
	    F   |   T  |   T   |    F   |     T      |         F        |     F       |        T
	    F   |   F  |   T   |    T   |     T      |         T        |     T       |        T
5. **Bi-conditional** (<-->)
     * If *p* and *q* are propositions, then we can form the bi-conditional proposition *p*<-->*q*, read as "*p* **if and only if** *q*"
     * *p*<-->*q* Truth Table:
        *p*           |          *q*          |     *p*<-->*q*
	   -----------------------------------
	   T           |          T         |         ***T***
	   T           |          F         |          F
	   F           |          T         |          F
	   F           |          F         |          ***T***

	It is essentially the **opposite** of **XOR**. **ALL** inputs must be the **same** for the output to be **true** (even if all inputs are false).

	**Example**:
	* If *p* denotes "I am at home" and *q* denotes "It is raining", then
	* *p*<-->*q* denotes "I am at home **if and only if** it is raining."

	**Different Ways of Expressing *p*-->*q***:
	* *p* **is necessary and sufficient for** *q*
	* **if** *p* **then** *q*, **and conversely**
	* *p* **iff** *q*

	***Important Note***:
	* *p*<-->*q* is the same as (*p*-->*q*) ∧ (*q*-->*p*)

#### Precedence of Logical Operators in Compound Propositions
* Assume the compound proposition *p*∨*q*-->¬*r*
* *How can we calculate it?*
* Will it be calculated as:
	* (*p*∨*q*)-->¬r
	or
	* *p*∨(q-->¬r)

Well, it depends on the precedence of the operators:
<u>Operator</u>     |    <u>Precedence</u>
¬                  |             1
∧                  |             2
∨                  |             3
->                 |             4
<->                |             5

Thus, the given compound proposition will be calculated as **(*p*∨*q*)-->¬r**

However, if the intended meaning was for it to be interpreted as *p*∨(q-->¬r) instead, then parenthesis must be used.
