So far, what we've learned is **not** enough to **predict**.
*What we know so far:*
- Propositions

### Propositional Logical Is Not Enough
If we have:
- "All men are mortal"
- "Socrates is a man"

Does it follow that "Socrates is mortal"?

***No***, it can't be represented in propositional logic

Instead, we will need a language that talks about **objects**, their **properties**, and their **relations**.

### Introducing Predicate Logic

Assume the following propositions:
- "A **dog** is an animal"
- "A **cat** is an animal"
- "A **tiger** is an animal"
- ...

Instead of the above repetition, we can **generalize** the proposition by saying:

"**x** is an animal"

'x' = variable
"is an animal" = predicate

We can also represent this as the function:

$P(x)$ = "**x** is an animal"

This is what we call a propositional function. They are a generalization of propositions:
- They contain variables and a predicate
- Variables can be replaced by elements from their **domain** (in the above case, the domain is animals)
- A propositional function might involve more than one variable, such as $Q(x,y,z,\dots)$

The function could also be written using:

$animal(x)$ 

**Important Notes**:
- A *propositional function* is not a proposition (we cannot say $P(x)$ is true or false)
- A *propositional function* is a **predicate**
	- As a result, a *propositional function* does not have a **truth value**
	- It will only have a **truth value** if we specify all variables in the function

### Propositional Functions

Propositional functions become propositions (and have truth values) ***only when*** **their variables** are:
1. Each replaced by a value from the **domain**
2. **Or** each *bound* by a quantifier - *as we'll see later*
3. **Or** a combination of both

**Example**
The statement $P(x)$ is said to be the value of the propositional function $P$ at $x$.

For example, let $P(x)$ denote "$x>0$" and the domain be the integers. Then:
$$
P(x) = x > 0 ~does~not~have~a~truth~value~(x~is~unknown)
$$
$$
P(-3) ~is~false
$$
$$
P(0)~is~false
$$
$$
P(3)~is~true
$$
$$
P(x) = x>0~for~every~x~-~truth~value~of~false~(later)
$$
$$
P(x) = x>0~for~some~x~-~truth~value~of~true~(later)
$$

Often the domain is denoted by $U$. So in this example, $U$ is the integers.

### Additional Propositional Function Examples

> Let $x + y = z$ be denoted by $R(x,y,z)$ and $U$ (for all three variables) be the **integers**. Find these truth values:

$R(2,-1,~5)$
$2+(-1) =1$
$1\neq 5$
**False**

$R(3,4,7)$
$3+4 =7$
$7=7$
**True**


$R(x,3,z)$
$x~is~unknown$
$z~is~unknown$
**Not A Proposition**

>  Let $x - y = z$ be denoted by $Q(x,y,z)$ with $U$ be as **integers**. Find these truth values:

$Q(2,-1,3)$
$2-(-1) = 3$
$3=3$
**True**

$Q(3,4,7)$
$3-4=-1$
$-1\neq 7$
**False**

$Q(x,3,z)$
$x~is~unknown$
$z~is~unknown$
**Not A Proposition**

### Compound Expressions

Connectives from **propositional logic** carry over to **predicate logic**.

> If $P(x)$ denotes $x>0$, and the domain $U$ is the integers - find these truth values:

$P(3)\lor P(-1)$
$T~\lor~F$
**True**

$P(3) \land P(-1)$
$T \land F$
**False**

$P(3)\to P(-1)$
$T\to F$
**False**

Expressions with variables are NOT propositions and therefore do not have truth values. For example,

$P(3)\land P(y)$ is NOT a proposition
$P(x)\to P(y)$ is NOT a proposition
