### Proof By Cases
To prove a conditional statement like:
$$
(p_{1}) \lor p_{2} \lor \dots \lor p_{n})\to q
$$
We could use the tautology:
$$
[(p_{1} \lor p_{2} \lor \dots \lor p_{n})\to q] \leftrightarrow [(p_{1} \to q) \land (p_{2} \to q)\land \dots \land (p_{n} \to q)]
$$
Where each **implication** $p_{i} \to q$ is a **case**


#### Why does this work?

$$
((p_{1} \lor p_{2} \lor \dots \lor p_{n})\to q) \equiv ((p_{1}\to q) \land (p_{2} \to q) \land \dots(p_{n} \to q))
$$
Let's prove it:
$$
((p_{1} \lor p_{2} \lor \dots \lor p_{n})\to q) \equiv \lnot (p_{1} \lor p_{2} \lor \dots \lor p_{n}) \lor q
$$
$$
\equiv (\lnot p_{1} \land \lnot p_{2} \land \dots \lnot p_{n})\lor q
$$
$$
\equiv (\lnot p \lor q) \land (\lnot p_{2} \lor q) \land \dots (\lnot p_{n} \lor q)
$$
$$
\equiv (p_{1} \to q) \land (p_{2} \to q) \land \dots (p_{n} \to q)
$$


#### Example

Assume: $a @ b = max[a,b]=$ $a$ if $a \geq b$ or $b$ otherwise

Prove that for all real numbers, $a,b,c$, the following is true:
$$
(a@b)@c = a@(b@c)
$$
Note:
- The relationship between $a$ and $b$ is controlled by an **operator**, and it does **not** matter which operator.
- The domain is **finite** and **small**, meaning we can try **all cases** from the domain.

**Proof:**
Let $a,b,$ and $c$ be **arbitrary** real numbers
Therefore, one of the following **6** cases must hold:
1. $a \geq b \geq c$
2. $a \geq c \geq b$
3. $b\geq a\geq c$
4. $b\geq c\geq a$
5. $c\geq a\geq b$
6. $c\geq b\geq a$

**Case 1**: $a \geq b \geq c$
Hence: 
	$a@b=a$
	$a@c=a$
	$b@c=b$
Let's substitute in the left and right hands sides:
	$(a@b)@c=a$        $lhs$
	$a@(b@c)=a$       $rhs$
Therefore, the equality holds for the first case.

### Existence Proof
**Two Types:**
1. Constructive existence proof
2. Nonconstructive existence proof

They are used to theorems of the form $\exists x P(x)$

#### Constructive Existence Proof:
1. Find an explicit value of $c$, for which $P(c)$ is true
2. Then $\exists x P(x)$ is true by Existential Generalization (EG)

##### Example:
Prove that there is a **positive integer** that can be written as the sum of cubes of positive integers in two different ways.

**Proof:**
Let's find a number that fulfills this

The number **1729** meets the conditions and can be written as the sum of cubes of positive integers in two different ways:
- $1729=10^3+9^3$
- $1729=12^3+1$

#### Nonconstructive Existence Proof:
In this proof, we do not find an element $c$ such that $P(c)$ is true, but rather prove that $\exists xP(x)$  is true in some other way.

##### Example:
Show that there exists two **irrational** numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $x^y$ is **rational**.

**Proof:**
We know that $\sqrt{ 2 }$ is irrational
So, let's consider the number $\sqrt{ 2 }^\sqrt{ 2 }$, and show the two cases as follows:
1. If $\sqrt{ 2 }^\sqrt{ 2 }$ is **rational**, we can choose two irrational numbers $x=\sqrt{ 2 }$ and $y=\sqrt{ 2 }$
2. If $\sqrt{ 2 }^\sqrt{ 2 }$ is **irrational**, then we can choose two irrational numbers $x=\sqrt{ 2 }^\sqrt{ 2 }$ and $y=\sqrt{ 2 }$ and calculate $x^y=(\sqrt{ 2 }^\sqrt{ 2 })^\sqrt{ 2 }$ $=$ $\sqrt{ 2 }^\sqrt{ 2 }$$^\sqrt{ 2 }$$=$$\sqrt{ 2 }^2=2$ which is **rational**

**Note**: This proof is an example of a nonconstructive existence proof because we do not know which of these two pairs works.

### Proof By Counterexample

- Recall that $\exists x \lnot P(x) \equiv \lnot \forall x P(x)$

- To establish that $\lnot \forall x P(x)$ is **true** (or $\forall x P(x)$ is **false**) find a sample $c$ from the domain such that
	- $\lnot P(c)$ is **true** or
	- $P(c)$ is **false**

- In this case, $c$ is called a **counterexample** to the assertion $\forall x P(x)$

##### Example
Prove that "Every positive integer is the sum of the squares of 3 integers"

**Proof**
- The integer 7 is a **counterexample**
- To show that there are no three squares that add up to 7, we note that the only possible squares we can use are those not exceeding 7, namely 0, 1, and 4
- Because no three terms where each term is 0, 1, or 4 add up to 7, it follows that 7 is a counterexample. Thus, the claim is false.

### Uniqueness Proof
**The two parts of a uniqueness proof are:**
1. Existence: We show that an element $x$ with the property exists
2. Uniqueness: We show that
	- if $y \neq x$, then $y$ does not have the property, or
	- if $y$ has the property, then $y=x$

##### Example
Show that if $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $a\neq0$, then there is a unique real number $r$ such that $ar+b=0$

**Solution:**

**Existence**: Find a solution for $ar+b=0$

$ar+b=0$
$ar+b-b=-b$
$ar=-b$

Therefore, the real number $r-\frac{b}{a}$ is a **solution**

**Uniqueness:**
- Suppose that $s$ is another solution
- Therefore, we can write $as+b=0$
- But from the existence step, we found a solution $r$ such that $ar+b=0$
- If we subtract the above two equations, we find
- $(as+b)-(ar+b)=0$
	$= as-ar=0$
	$= a(s-r)=0$
- Therefore, either:
	- $a=0$, which **contradicts** with the given restriction
	- Or, $s-r=0$ which leads to $$
