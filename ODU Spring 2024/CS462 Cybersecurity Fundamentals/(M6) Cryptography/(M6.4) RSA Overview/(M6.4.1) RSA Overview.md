RSA is an algorithm invented by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman for generating and using these special private and public keys.

RSA public key cryptography consists of three parts: 
1) Key generation 
2) Encryption
3) Decryption

## Key Generation

- Choose two large prime numbers, $p$ and $q$, which you keep secret
- $n = p \times q$
- $z = (p-1)(q-1)$ – note that $z$ is also called $\phi(n)$ (phi)
- Generate your public key
    - Choose a number $e < n$ that is _relatively prime_ to $z$ (meaning that $e$ and $z$ have no common factors, other than 1)
    - Public key, $K^+ = (n, e)$
- Generate your private key
    - Find the number $d$ such that $e^d-1$ is exactly divisible by $z$ (or $e^d\mod z = 1$)
    - Private key, $K^- = (n, d)$

## Encryption/Decryption

- Encrypt a message $m$: ciphertext$~c = m^e \mod n$
- Decrypt a ciphertext $c: m = c^d \mod n$
