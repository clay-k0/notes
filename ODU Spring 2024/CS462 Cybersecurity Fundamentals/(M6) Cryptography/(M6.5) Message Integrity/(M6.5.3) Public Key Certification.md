## Digital Certificates

**A public key certificate**
- Binds a public key with a digital signature

**The digital signature adds trust**
- PKI uses Certificate Authority for additional trust
- Web of Trust adds other users for additional trust

**Certificate creation can be build into the OS**
- Part of Windows Domain services
- 3rd-party Linux options

### What Do They Look Like?

| Field | Usage |
| ---- | ---- |
| Version | The X.509 version supported (V1, V2, or V3) |
| Serial Number | A number uniquely identifying the certificate within the domain of its CA. |
| Signature Algorithm | The algorithm used by the CA to sign the certificate |
| Issuer | The name of the CA, expressed as a Distinguished Name (DN) |
| Valid From / Valid To | Date and time during which the certificate is valid |
| Subject | The name of the certificate holder, expressed as a Distinguished Name (DN) |
| Public Key | Public key and algorithm used by the certificate holder |
| Extensions | V3 certificates can be defined with extended attributes, such as friendly subject or issuer names, contact email addresses, and intended key usage. |

## Certificate Extensions

**Add more information to a digital certificate**
- Extension ID (extnID)
- Critical - True/False
- Value (extnValue) - The string value of the extension

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

**Policies, procedures, hardware, software, people**
- Digital certificates: create, distribute, manage, store, revoke

**This is a BIG thing**
- Lots of planning involved

**Also refers to the binding of public keys to people**
- The certificate authority
- It's all about trust

### The Key Management Lifecycle

**Key generation**
- Create a key with the request strength using the proper cipher

**Certificate generation**
- Allocate a key to a user

**Distribution**
- Makes the key available to the user

**Storage**
- Secure storage and protection against unauthorized used

**Revocation**
- Manage keys that have been compromised

**Expiration**
- A certificate may only have a certain "shelf life"
