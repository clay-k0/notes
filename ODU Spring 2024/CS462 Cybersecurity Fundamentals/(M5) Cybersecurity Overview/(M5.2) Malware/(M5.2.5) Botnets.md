**Once your machine is infected, it becomes a bot**
- You may not even know

**How does it get on your computer?**
- Trojan Horse or running a program/clicking an ad you thought was legit
- OS or application vulnerability

**A day in the life of a bot**
- Sit around, check in with the mothership, wait for instructions
- These are what listen for keystrokes

One of the worst botnets we've seen is ZeuS - a botnet for stealing money.

### Summary
A botnet is essentially an army of infected computers that are used to perpetrate a cyberattack (spam, denial of service, etc.). The owners of these infected computers are often unaware that their computers are part of a botnet. The computers have been initially infected through other types of malware, such as a Trojan horse.
