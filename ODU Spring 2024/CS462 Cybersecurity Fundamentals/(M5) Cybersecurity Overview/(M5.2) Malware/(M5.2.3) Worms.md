### Worms
**Malware that self-replicates**
- Doesn't need you to do anything
- Uses the network as a transmission medium

**Worms are quite bad**
- Can take over many PCs very quickly

**Worms can do good things**
- "Nachi" tried to patch computers

**Firewalls and IDS/IPS can mitigate many worm infestations**
- Doesn't help much once the worm gets in

Worm programmers spend a lot of time ensuring the worm is hard to take down. A prime example of this is the Conficker worm, the deadliest worm we've ever seen that used autorun-worm techniques, spreading itselfÂ via removable USB thumb drives. Another is Stuxnet, a worm that targeted Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in order to overload machine processes.

### Summary
Unlike viruses, worms do not need user interaction. They can propagate just by an infected computer being turned on. Worms exploit security vulnerabilities in software, using the software to activate and propagate the worm.
