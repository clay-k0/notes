### The Transport Layer
**Transport services and protocols**

Transfer Protocols
- Provide *logical communication* between application processes running on different hosts
- Execute on the end systems (and *not* in the network)

Transport v. Network Layer Services
- *Network Layer*: data transfer between end systems
- *Transport Layer*: data transfer between processes
	- Relies on, and enhances, network layer services

### Transport Layer Protocols (Review)
**Internet Transport Services**

TCP: Reliable, in-order, unicast delivery
- Congestion control
- Flow control
- Connection setup

UDP: Unreliable, ordered ("best-effort"), unicast delivery
- (Minimal) error detection

Services not available:
- Performance guarantees
	- No guarantees of available bandwidth
	- No guarantees of end-to-end delay

### Fundamental Transport Layer Services
**Multiplexing/Demultiplexing**

Each end-system has a single protocol "stack"
- The stack is shared between all applications using the network

Multiplexing is the process of allowing multiple applications to use the network simultaneously
- To send data into the network concurrently

Demultiplexing is the process of delivering received data to the appropriate application

### Multiplexing/Demultiplexing
**Review: Protocol Layering**

At the sender, each layer takes data from above
- May subdivide into multiple data units at sending layer
- Adds header information to create new data unit
- Passes new data unit to layer below

The process is reserved at the receiver

**Demultiplexing**
Demultiplexing is the process of delivering received segments to the correct application-layer process
- IP address (In network-layer datagram header) identifies the receiving machine
- Port number (in transport-layer segment header) identifies the receiving

**Transport Protocol Specific Demultiplexing**
Demultiplexing actions depend on whether the transport layer is connectionless (UDP) or connection-oriented (TCP)

UDP demultiplexes segments to the *socket*
- UDP uses 2-tuple
	- $<destination~IP~address,~destination~port~number>$ to identify the socket
	- Socket is "owned" by some process (allocated by OS)

TCP demultiplexes segments to the *connection*
- TCP uses 4-tuple
	- $<source~IP~address,~source~port~nbr,~destination~IP~addr,~destination~port~nbr>$ to identify connection
- Connection (and its socket) is owned by some process
