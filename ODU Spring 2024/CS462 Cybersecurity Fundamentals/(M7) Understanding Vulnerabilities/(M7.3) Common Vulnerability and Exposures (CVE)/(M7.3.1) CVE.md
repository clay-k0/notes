**Vulnerability Database**: Stores information on known vulnerabilities
- Assigning them identification, known reasons, and mitigation if known

We need a common taxonomy to classify and talk about vulnerabilities
- This will help in using solutions that are already available

### CVE
[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/) is not a vulnerability database, but it is designed to allow vulnerability databases and other capabilities to be linked together, and facilitate the comparison of security tools and services. Note: it does not include risk impact or mitigation information.

A CVE identifier includes:
- CVE Identifier number (i.e., "CVE-1999-0067", "CVE-2014-10001", "CVE-2014-100001").
- Brief description of the security vulnerability or exposure.
- Any pertinent references (i.e., vulnerability reports and advisories).

A vulnerability description looks something like
[PROBLEM TYPE] in [PRODUCT/VERSION] causes [IMPACT] when [ATTACK]
