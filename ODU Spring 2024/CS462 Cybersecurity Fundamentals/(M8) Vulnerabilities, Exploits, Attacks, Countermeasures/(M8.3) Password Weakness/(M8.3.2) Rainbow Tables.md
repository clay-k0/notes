Three common ways of attacking passwords are:

1. **Dictionary Attack, Brute Force Attack, Rainbow Table Based Attacks**:
	- Dictionary attacks check passwords against a dictionary
	- Brute force attacks check against all character combinations
		- Minimum six alphanumeric characters allow 366 attempts to break a password
	- Rainbow tables store hashes of possible passwords

2. **Rainbowcrack** is a tool available on Windows and Linux
	- It allows fast computation to use rainbow tables
	- Rainbow tables for multiple hash schemes can be found online

3. **Rainbow Tables** provide a tradeoff between memory and time
	 - You reduce computational time at the expense of storing a large number of password hashes
