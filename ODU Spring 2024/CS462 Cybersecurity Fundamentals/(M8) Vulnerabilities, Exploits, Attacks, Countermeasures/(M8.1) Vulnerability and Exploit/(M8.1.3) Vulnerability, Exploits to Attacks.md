Exploit usage is an attack.

**Example:**
- A "no password enforcement" policy is a vulnerability leading to a possibility of weak passwords
- "Dictionary" can be used as an exploit
- An attempt to break passwords using a dictionary ("dictionary attack") is an attack

An attack is a deliberate attempt at exploiting a vulnerability
- Natural disasters are not considered attacks or security breaches
- An attack is not necessarily a successful attempt
