We mentioned earlier that HTTP is a stateless protocol. But, sometimes we would like web servers to remember something about us – our login credentials, our amazon wish lists, etc. Cookies allow web servers to associate information with a particular user.

A web server will present a client with a cookie to store. Then, each time the client visits that server, it will include the cookie in the HTTP request. That way, the server knows that it's talking to the same client as before. Unfortunately, cookies can also be a security vulnerability.

Cookies are stored and associated with a single machine and browser, unless you use something like Google Sync to synchronize cookies on multiple machines.

There are three basic types of cookies:

| Persistent Cookie <br>                     | A cookie that isn't deleted when the browser closes, often implemented by allowing the user to check a “remember me” checkbox to change a session cookie to a persistent one |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Session Cookie**                         | **A cookie that is deleted when the browser closes**                                                                                                                         |
| **Tracking Cookie, or Third-Party Cookie** | **Cookies can be used by advertisers to track a user’s clicks on the web. In particular, a server can determine that someone who visited Site A also visited Site B.**       |

### HTTP User-Server Interaction: Cookies
Server sends "cookie" to browser in response message
- Set-cookie:$<value>$
Browser presents cookie in later requests to same server
- cookie: $<value>$
Server matches cookie with server-stored information
- Provides authentication
- Client-side state maintenance (remembering user preferences, previous choices, ...)
