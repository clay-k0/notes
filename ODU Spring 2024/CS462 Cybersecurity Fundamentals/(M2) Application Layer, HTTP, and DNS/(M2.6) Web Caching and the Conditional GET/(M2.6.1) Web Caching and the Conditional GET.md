### Caching on the Web
**Web Caches (Proxy Servers)**

- Web caches are used to satisfy client request without contacting the origin server
- Users configure browsers to send all requests through a shared proxy server
	- Proxy server is a large cache of web objects
- Browsers send all HTTP requests to proxy
	- If object in cache, proxy returns object in HTTP response
	- Else proxy requests object from origin server, then returns it in a HTTP response to the browser

### HTTP Response Code 304: Not Modified
HTTP response code: 304 Not Modified

- Sent in response to a conditional GET request
- Conditional GET includes the If-modified-since header option
- Used in web caching
- Proxy asks the web server if the requested object has been modified since a certain date/time
- Date/time is usually the timestamp present on the cached version of the object (Last-Modified response header)
- If the object hasn't changed since the specified date, the web server responds with 304 Not Modified
- In this case, the web server does not send the object
- If the object has changed, the web server responds with a normal 200 OK status and includes the object as the response body

### HTTP User-Server Information
- Goal: don't send object if cache has up-to-date cached version
	- No object transmission delay
	- Lower link utilization
- Proxy specifies the date of the cached copy in HTTP request
	- If-modified-since:$<date>$
- Server's response contains the object only if it has been changed since the cached date
- Otherwise, server returns: HTTP/1.0 304 Not Modified

Below is an example of an HTTP response with the `Last-Modified` option (shown in bold).
