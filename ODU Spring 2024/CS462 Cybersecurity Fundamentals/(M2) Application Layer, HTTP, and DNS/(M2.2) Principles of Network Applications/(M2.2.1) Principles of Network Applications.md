### Applications and Application-Layer Protocols
**Overview**

**Application: Communicating, Distributed Processes**
- Running in network hosts in "user space"
- Exchange messages to implement application

**Application-Layer Protocols**
- One "piece" of an application
- Defines messages exchanged and actions taken
- Uses services provided by lower layer protocols

### Application-Layer Protocols
**Client-Server Architecture**

**Server**
- Always-on host
- Permanent IP address
- Server farms for scaling

**Client**
- Communicate with server
- May be intermittently connected
- May have dynamic IP addresses
- Do not communicate directly with each other

### The Application Layer
**The Client-Server Paradigm**

Typical network applications have two pieces: *client* and *server*

**Client**
- Initiates contact with server ("speaks first")
- Requests service from server
- For Web, client is implemented in browser; for e-mail, in mail reader

**Server**
- Provides requested service to client
- "Always" running
- May also include a "client interface"

### Client/Server Paradigm
**Socket Programming**

socket:
	*a host-local, application created/released, OS-controlled interface into which an application process can both send and receive messages to/from another (remote or local) application process*

Sockets are the fundamental building block for client/server systems

Socket are created and managed by application
- Strong analogies with files

Two types of transport services are available via the socket API:
- UDP sockets: reliable, stream-oriented communications 
- TCP sockets: unreliable, datagram-oriented communications

Sockets are essentially a "door" between application processes and end-to-end transport protocols

### Socket Programming Using TCP
**TCP Socket Programming Model**

A TCP socket provides a reliable bi-directional communication channel from one process to another.    

Before data can be transmitted, TCP requires *connection setup* (UDP doesn't)
- called a 3-way handshake

**Network Addressing For Sockets**

Sockets are addressed using an IP address and port number

### Socket Programming Using UDP
**UDP Socket Programming Model**

A UDP socket provides an unreliable bi-directional communication channel from one process to another
- A "datagram" abstraction


### Internet Transport Protocols
**Services Provided**

| TCP Service | UDP Service |
| ---- | ---- |
| - *connection-oriented*: setup required between client and server | - *unreliable* data transfer between sending and receiving process |
| - *reliable transport* between sending and receiving process | - *does not provide*: connection setup, reliability, flow control, timing, or minimum bandwidth guarantees |
| - *flow control*: sender won't overwhelm receiver |  |
| - *congestion control*: throttle sender when network overloaded |  |
| - *does not provide*: timing, minimum bandwidth guarantees |  |

### Internet Applications
**Application and Transport Protocols**

| Application | Application-Layer Protocol | Underlying Transport Protocol |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| E-Mail | SMTP [RFC 2821] | TCP |
| Remote Terminal Access | Telnet [RFC 854] | TCP |
| Web | HTTP [RFC 2616] | TCP |
| File Transfer | FTP [RFC 959] | TCP |
| Streaming Multi-Media | HTTP (YouTube) | TCP |
| Internet Telephony | Proprietary (e.g., Skype) | UDP or TCP |
