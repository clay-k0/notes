Wikipedia has a comprehensive [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers) that indicates whether the use of the port is official, unofficial, or has multiple uses.

There are three classes of port numbers:

| Well-Known Ports | Reserved Ports | Dynamic, or Private Ports |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Numbered between 0-1023, reserved for system processes | Numbered between 1024-49151, can be registered for use with the IANA, but can also typically be used by ordinary users | Numbered between 49152-65535, cannot be registered for use with the IANA |

The standard [list](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt) of registered ports resides with the IANA.


Different operating systems may also use special ports for their services. Here's the [list](http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1629) for Apple
