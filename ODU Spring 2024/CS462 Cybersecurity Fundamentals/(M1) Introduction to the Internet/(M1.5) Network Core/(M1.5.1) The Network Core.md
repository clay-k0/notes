### The Network Core

- A mesh of interconnected routers

- Hosts break application-layer messages into packets

- Routers forward packets from one router to the next, across links on path from source to destination


### Host
##### Sends Packets of Data
- Takes application message
- Breaks into smaller chunks, known as **packets**, of length $L$ bits
- Transmits packet into access network at **transmission rate** $R$
	- link transmission rate / link **capacity** / link **bandwidth**

$$
packet~transmission~delay = time~to~transmit~L-bit~packet~into~link = \frac{L~(bits)}{R (bits/sec)} 
$$

### Packet Switching
##### Store and Forward
- Takes $L/R$ seconds to transmit (push out) packet of $L$ bits on to link at $R$ bps
- Store and forward: entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link
- delay (for one packet) = $2L/R$ (assuming 0 propagation delay)

**Example**
- $L$ = 7.5 Mbits
- $R$ = 1.5 Mbps
- 7.5/1.5 = 5, so one-hop transmission delay = 5 sec

**Practice**
$L$ bits per packet                                         router
      📦 📦 📦        source ⌨️ -------$R$ bps----⚪️-----$R$ bps----------🖥️ Destination
           3                                            1                          2

How long until the destination receives all 3 packets?

Here we have 3 packets with 2 links:
- L/R        packet 1 at router
- 2 L/R     packet 2 at router     packet 1 at destination
- 3 L/R     packet 3 at router     packet 2 at destination
- 4 L/R                                        packet 3 at destination

What is the delay for $P$ packets of length $L$ sent over a series of $N$ links?
(P+N-1) L/R

**End-to-end/Queuing Delay**
$$
d_{end-to-end} = N\frac{L}{R}
$$

##### Queuing Delay and Loss
- If arrival rate (in bits) to link exceeds transmission rate of link for a period of time:
	- Packets will queue, wait to be transmitted on link
	- Packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) fills up

##### Two Key Functions
- **Routing**: determines source-destination route taken by packets
	- routing algorithms
- **Forwarding:** move packets from router's input to appropriate router output


### Internet Structure
**Network of Networks**
- End systems connect to Internet via access ISPs (Internet Service Providers)
	- Residential, company and university ISPs
- Access ISPs in turn must be interconnected
	- So that any two hosts can send packets to each other
- Resulting network of networks is very complex
	- Evolution was driven by economics and national policies
