## Biological Productivity and Energy Transfer

### Primary Productivity

- Rate at which energy is stored in organic matter
	- **Photosynthesis** uses solar radiation
	- **Chemosynthesis** uses chemical reaction
- 99.9% of the ocean's **biomass** relies directly or indirectly on photosynthesis for food

### Measurement of Primary Productivity

- Directly - capture plankton in **plankton nets**
- Measure radioactive carbon in seawater

- Monitor ocean color with satelites
	- Photosynthetic **phytoplankton** use **chlorophyll**
		- Green pigment
	- **SeaWiFS** (Sea-viewing Wide Field of View Sensor)
		- Satellite sensor collected ocean color data from 1997-2010
	- **MODIS** (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)
		- Currently used

### Factors Affecting Primary Productivity

- Nutrient availability
	- Nitrate, phosphorous, iron, silica
		- Most from river runoff
	- Productivity high along continental margins
		- **Eutrophication** - enrichment of ecosystems with chemical nutrients
				- Nitrates and phosphates in garden/farm fertilizers wash into coastal areas
				- Unintended consequences
				- More later
- In open ocean, lack of nutrients limits productivity

- Solar radiation
	- Uppermost surface seawater and shallow seafloor
	- **Compensation depth** - net photosynthesis becomes zero
	- **Euphotic zone** - from surface to compensation depth (about 100 m or 330 ft.)

### Light Transmission in Ocean Water

- **Visible light** portion of the **electromagnetic spectrum**
- Blue wavelengths penetrate deepest
- Longer wavelengths (red, orange) absorbed first

### Color in the Ocean

- Color of ocean ranges from deep blue to yellow-green
- Factors
	- Turbidity from runoff
		- Suspended sediment
	- Photosynthetic pigment
		- Chlorophyll
- **Secchi Disk** - measures water transparency

- Coastal and upwelling areas productive
	- Light green
	- **Eutrophic**
- Open ocean lacks productivity
	- Dark blue
	- **Oligotrophic**


### Upwelling and Nutrient Supply

- Flow of deep water to surface
- Cooler, deeper seawater is nutrient-rich
- Areas of coastal upwelling = high productivity
	- Western continental margins

### Types of Photosynthetic Marine Organisms

- **Anthophyta**
	- Seed-bearing plants
- **Macroscopic (large) algae**
- **Microscopic (small) algae**
- **Photosynthetic bacteria**

### Anthophyta

- Only in shallow coastal waters
- Primarily grasses and mangroves
- Important sources of food and protection for near shore animals

### Macroscopic Algae - "Sea Weeds"

- **Green algae**
	- Common in freshwater
	- Chlorophyll
- **Red algae**
	- Phylum Rhodophyta is most abundant and most widespread
	- Varied colors
	- Rare in freshwater
- **Brown algae**
	- Middle latitudes
	- Colder water

### Microscopic Algae

- Produce food for 99% of marine animals
- Most planktonic
- **Golden algae**
	- **Diatoms - tests** (shells) made of silica
	- **Coccolithophores** - plates of calcium carbonate

- **Dinoflagellates**
	- Possess **flagella** for locomotion
	- **Red tide (harmful algal bloom)**
	- Toxins
	- Kills fish
	- Human illness

### Red Tides

- April through September most dangerous in Northern Hemisphere
- Dinoflagellates associated with **ciguatera**
	- Causes most human cases of seafood poisoning

### Ocean Eutrophication and Dead Zones

- **Eutrophication** - enrichment of waters by previously scarce nutrient
	- Can cause harmful algal bloom
- **Cultural eutrophication** - speeding up natural eutrophication through human activities
	- Phosphates (through detergent), sewage, fertilizer, animal waste

- **Dead zones** - hypotoxic (oxygen-poor) water
	- Mouths of major rivers
	- Spring runoffs
- Suffocates bottom dwellers

- Global dead zones - significant increase since 1960s
- More than 500 worldwide

### Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone

- Second largest in the world - 22,000 sq. km (8500 sq. mi)
- Runoff of nutrients
	- Especially nitrates
	- Algal blooms

### Photosynthetic Bacteria

- Extremely small
- Exert critical influence on marine ecosystems
- **Prochlorococcus** - most abundant and smallest marine phytoplankton
	- At least half world ocean's photosynthetic biomass

### Regional Primary Productivity Variations

- Values range from 1 gC/m$^2$/year to 400 gC/m$^2$/year
	- Uneven distribution of nutrients
	- Seasonal changes in availability of sunlight
- 90% of biomass from euphotic zone decomposes before descending
	- 10% sinks to deeper ocean

- Only 1% of organic matter is not decomposed in the deep ocean
- **Biological pump** - moves material from euphotic zone to sea floor
- Subtropical gyre thermoclines and pycnoclines prevent the resupply of nutrients to the surface

### Polar Ocean Productivity

- Winter darkness
- Summer sunlight
- Phytoplankton bloom
	- Diatoms
- Zooplankton increase follow
- Example: Arctic Ocean's Barents Sea

### Polar Ocean Productivity

- Antarctic productivity slightly greater than Arctic
- North Atlantic Deep Water upwells near Antarctica
- **Isothermal** waters - no barrier to mixing
- Plankton remain at surface
- Blue whales migrate to feed on maximum zooplankton productivity

### Tropical Ocean Productivity

- Permanent thermocline is barrier to vertical mixing
- Low rate of primary productivity - lack of nutrients
- High primary productivity in areas of
	- **Equatorial upwelling**
	- **Coastal upwelling**
	- **Coral reefs**
		- Symbiotic algae
			- Zooxanthellae
		- Recycle nutrients within ecosystem

### Temperature Ocean Productivity

- Productivity limited by
	- Available sunlight
	- Available nutrients
- Highly seasonal pattern
	- Winter low
		- Many nutrients
		- Little sunlight
	- Spring high
		- **Spring bloom**
	- Summer low
		- Few nutrients
		- Abundant sunlight
	- Fall high
		- **Fall bloom**

### Energy Flow in Marine Systems

- **Ecosystem** - living organisms (biotic community) plus environment
	- **Producers** (autotrphic)
		- Nourish themselves by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis
	- **Consumers** eat other organisms (heterotrophic)
		- **Herbivores** - eat plants
		- **Carnivores** - eat other animals
		- **Omnivores** - eat plants and animals
		- **Bacteriovores** - eat bacteria
	- **Decomposers** (heterotrophic)
		- Break down dead organisms or waste

### Nutrient Flow in Marine Ecosystems

- **Detritus** - dead remains and waste products
- **Biogeochemical cycles** - chemical parts of matter cycled through ecosystem
	- Examples:
		- Nutrients fixed by producers
		- Passed on to consumers
		- Some nutrients released to seawater by decomposers
		- Nutrients recycled through upwelling

### Feeding Strategies

- **Suspension feeding (or filter feeding)** 
	- Take in seawater and filter out usable organic matter
- **Deposit feeding**
	- Take in detritus and sediment, extract usable organic matter
- **Carnivorous feeding** 
	- Capture and eat other animals

### Trophic Levels

- Chemical energy transferred from producers (algae) to consumers
- ~10% of energy transferred to next trophic level
- Feeding population generally slightly larger
	- Exception: Blue whale (100 ft.) feeds on **krill** (2.4 in.)

### Food Chains

- Primary producer
- Herbivore
- One or more carnivores

### Food Webs

- Branching network of many consumers
- Consumers more likely to survive with alternative food sources

### Biomass Pyramid

- Number of individuals and total biomass decrease at successive trophic levels
- Organisms increase in size up pyramid

### Marine Fisheries

- Commercial fishing
- Most from continental shelves
- Over 20% from areas of upwelling that make up 0.1% of ocean surface area

### Overfishing

- Fish from **standing stock** - the mass present in the ecosystem at any given time
- **Overfishing** - fish stock harvested too rapidly; juveniles not sexually mature to reproduce
- Reduction in **Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)**
	- Max amount of biomass that can be removed yearly from stock and still allow population to be sustained indefinitely

### Incidental Catch or Bycatch

- Non-commercial species are taken incidentally by commercial fishers
- Average of 25% of catch discarded as bycatch
	- Birds, turtles, dolphins, sharks

### Tuna and Dolphins

- Tuna and dolphins swim together
- Caught in purse seine net
- **Marine Mammals Protection Act** dolphin addendum
	- **Driftnets** or **gill nets** banned in 1989

### Fisheries Management

- Consumer choices in seafood
- Consume and purchase seafood from healthy, thriving fisheries
	- Examples: farmed seafood, Alaska salmon
- Ecosystem-based fishery management
- Avoid overfished or depleted seafood
	- Examples: tuna, shark, shrimp
