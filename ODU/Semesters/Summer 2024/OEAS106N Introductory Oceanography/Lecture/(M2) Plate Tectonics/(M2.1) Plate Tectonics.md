## Plate Tectonics and the Ocean Floor

### Continental Drift Hypothesis

- Alfred Wegener first proposed in 1912

#### Evidence for Continental Drift

- Wegener proposed **Pangaea** - one large continent existed 200 million years ago
- **Panthalassa** - one large ocean
- Included the **Tethys Sea**
- Noted puzzle-like fit of modern continents
	- Puzzle-like fit corroborated in 1960s

- **Sir Edward Bullard** used computer models to fit continents
	- Continental shelf
- Matching sequences of rocks and mountain chains
- Similar rock types, ages, and structures on different continents
	- Appalachians
	- British Isles
	- Caledonian Mountains

- Evidence of glaciation in now tropical regions
	- Glacial deposits
	- Striations

- Fossil distribution
	- Glossopteris
		- Plant
		- Heavy seeds
	- Mesosaurus
		- Fresh water animal
	- Lystosaurus and Cynogntathus
		- Non-swimming

### Objections to Early Continental Drift Model

- 1915 - Wegener published _The Origins of Continents and Oceans_
	- Continents plow through oceanic lithosphere
	- Tidal gravitational attractions too small to move continents
- Met with hostile criticism and open ridicule
	- Proposed mechanism defies laws of physics
- 1930 - Wegener, 50, dies on arctic expedition
	- Continental drift unproven at the time
		- No driving mechanism identified

### Evidence for Plate Tectonics

- New evidence from World War II
	- Sea floor studies with sonar
- New technology enabled study of Earth's **magnetic field**

- **Paleomagnetism**
	- Ancient magnetism preserved in rocks
	- Paleomagnetic records show
		- Polar wandering (evidence that continents moved)
		- Earth's magnetic field reversals
			- Recorded in rocks as they form at oceanic ridges

- Apparent **polar wandering**
- Location of North Pole changed over time

### Magnetic Field Reversals

- **Normal polarity** - magnetic field at present day and in the past when polarity was the same as the present
- **Reverse polarity** - magnetic field was opposite polarity from the present

### Paleomagnetism and the Ocean Floor

- **Magnetic anomalies** - pattern of "stripes"
	- Symmetric on either side of mid-ocean ridge

### Sea Floor Spreading

- **Harry Hess**
	- World War II submarine captain and geologist
- Depth recordings show sea floor features
- History of Ocean Basins
	- **Seafloor spreading**
	- **Mantle convection cells** as driving mechanism

#### Evidence for Sea Floor Spreading

- **Frederick Vine** and **Drummond Matthews** (1963)
- Analysis of igneous rock stripes around mid-ocean ridge
- Sea floor stripes record Earth's magnetic polarity

### Deep Sea Drilling - late 1960s

- Seafloor age increases with distance from MOR
	- Radiometric dating of ocean rocks
	- Oldest ocean floor only **180 millions years old**
- Sediment thickens with distance from MOR

#### Earthquakes as Evidence

- Large earthquakes at subduction zones
- Earthquake activity mirrors tectonic plate boundaries

### Plate Tectonics Theory

- **Lithosphere** (sphere of rock) - crust and upper mantle that acts as rigid solid; broken into lithospheric plates
- **Asthenosphere** (weaker sphere) - flows as ductile plastic

### Type of Plate Boundaries

- Divergent
- Convergent
- Transform

### Divergent Boundary Features

- Plates move apart
- Mid-ocean ridge
	- Rift valley
- New ocean floor created
	- Basalt
- Shallow focus earthquakes

### Types of Spreading Centers

- **Oceanic rise**
	- Fast-spreading (8-18 cm/yr)
	- Gentle slopes
	- East Pacific

- **Oceanic ridge**
	- Slow-spreading (2-5 cm/yr)
	- Steep slopes
	- Mid-Atlantic

- **Ultra-slow**
	- Less than 2 cm/yr
	- Deep rift valley
	- Widely scattered volcanoes
	- Arctic and southwest India

### Convergent Boundary Features

- Plates move toward each other
- Oceanic crust destroyed
	- Ocean trench
	- Volcanic arc
- Deep focus earthquakes

#### Types of Convergent Boundaries

- **Oceanic-Continental** Convergence
	- Ocean plate is subducted
		- Trench
		- Continental volcanic arc
	- Explosive andesitic volcanic eruptions

- **Oceanic-Oceanic** Convergence
	- Denser plate is subducted
		- Trench
		- Volcanic island arc

- **Continental-Continental** Convergence
	- No subduction
	- Folded mountain belt
	- NO volcanism
- Himalayas
	- India-Asia collision

### Transform Boundary

- **Oceanic Transform Fault** - ocean floor only
- **Continental Transform Fault** - cuts across continent
	- San Andreas Fault
- Transform faults connect segments of MOR
- Shallow but strong earthquakes

### Heat Flow

- **Heat flow** - heat from Earth's interior released to surface
- Very high at mid-ocean ridges
- Low at subduction zones

### Plate Tectonics Theory

- **Driving Mechanism**
	- Ridge-push - elevation of MOR pushes plate away
	- Slab-pull - suction and gravity of subduction pulls plate
	- Mantle convection adds or subtracts to movement

### Applications of Plate Tectonics

- **Mantle Plumes** and **Hotspots**
	- Intraplate features
		- Volcanic islands within a plate
		- Island chains
	- Record ancient plate motions
		- **Nematath** - hotspot track

### Plate Tectonics and Intraplate Features

- **Seamounts**
	- Rounded tops
- **Tablemounts** or **guyots**
	- Flattened tops
- Subsidence of flans of mid-ocean ridge
- Wave erosion may flatten seamount

### Coral Reef Development

- **Fringing reefs** - develop along margin of landmass
- **Barrier reefs** - separated from landmass by lagoon
- **Atolls** - volcano submerged; reef continues growth

### Paleogeography

- **Paleogeography** - study of ancient continents
- **Continental accretion**
	- Continental material added to edges of continents through plate motion

- **Pangaea** - ~300 million years ago
	- Separated 180 million years ago

### Breakup of Pangaea

- 180 million years ago - Pangaea separated
	- N. and S. America rifted from Europe and Africa
	- Atlantic Ocean forms

- 120 million years ago - S. America and Africa clearly separated

- 45 million years ago - India starts Asia collision
	- Australia moving north from Antarctica

### Future Predictions: 50 million years

- Assume same direction and rate of plate motions
	- Atlantic will enlarge, Pacific will shrink
	- New sea from East Africa rift valleys
	- Further Himalaya uplift
	- Separation of North and South America
	- Part of California in Alaska

### Wilson Cycle

- Plate tectonics model
	- Life cycle of ocean basins
		- Formation
		- Growth
		- Destruction
