## Marine Provinces

### Bathymetry

- Measures ocean depths and the charting of the shape of the ocean floor
	- Involves measuring vertical distance from ocean surface down to seafloor features

#### Measuring Bathymetry

- **Soundings**
	- **Poseidonus** made first sounding in 85 B.C.
	- Line with heavy weight (~2 km)

- **Fathom**
	- Standard unit of measure
	- 1.8 meters (6 feet)

- **HMS Challenger** - 1872
	- First systematic measurements
	- Deep ocean floor has _relief_
		- Variations in sea floor depth

- **Echo Soundings**
	- Echo sounder (Fathometer)
	- Reflection of sound signals (pings)
	- German ship _Meteor_ identified mid-Atlantic ridge in 1925
- Lacks detail
- Accuracy?
	- Marine life?
		- D.S.L

- **Precision Depth Recorder (PDR)**
	- 1950s
	- Focused high-frequency sound beam
	- First reliable sea floor maps produced
	- Helped confirm sea floor spreading

#### Modern Bathymetry Measuring

- **Multi-beam Echo Sounders**
	- Multiple simultaneous sound frequencies

- **Seabeam**
	- First multi-beam echo sounder
	- Map sea floor strips up to 60 km (37 mi) wide

- **Sonar**
	- Sound navigation and ranging
- **Side scan sonar**
- Can be towed behind ship to provide detailed bathymetric strip map
- Data gap directly beneath

- **Seismic Reflection Profiles**
	- Air guns
	- Low-frequency sounds
	- Details structure _beneath_ sea floor
	- Mineral and petroleum exploration

### Sea Floor Mapping from Space

- Uses satellite measurements
- Measures sea floor features based on gravitation bulges in sea surface
- Indirectly reveals bathymetry

- Satellite-derived ocean surface gravity
- Reveals bathymetry where ships have not conducted research

### Ocean Provinces

Three Major Provinces:

- **Continental margins**
	- Shallow-water areas close to shore

- **Deep-ocean basins**
	- Deep-water areas farther from land

- **Mid-ocean ridge**
	- Submarine mountain range

### Continental Margins

- **Active**
	- Associated with convergent or transform plate boundaries
	- Much tectonic activity
	- Example: West coasts of United States and South America

- **Passive**
	- Not close to any plate boundary
	- No major tectonic activity
	- Example: East cost of United States

#### Active Continental Margins

- **Convergent Active Margin**
	- Oceanic-continent convergent plate boundaries
	- Active continental volcanoes
	- Narrow shelf
	- Offshore trench
	- Western South America

- **Transform Continental Margin**
	- Transform plate boundaries
	- Close to shore:
		- Linear islands
		- Shallow banks
		- Deep basins
	- Coastal California
		- San Andreas Fault

#### Passive Continental Margin Features

- Continental shelf
- Shelf break
- Continental slope
- Continental rise

### Continental Shelf

- Flat zone form shore to shelf break
	- Covered by sediment deposits
	- Underlain by continental crust - **granitic**
- Geologically part of continent
- Average width is 70 km (43 miles)
	- Can extend to 1500 km (930 miles)
- Average depth of shelf break is 135 meters (443 ft)

### Continental Slope

- Where deep ocean basins begin
- Greater slope than continental shelf
	- Averages 4 degrees but varies 1-25 degrees gradient
- Marked by **Submarine canyons**

### Submarine Canyons

- Narrow, deep, V-shaped in profile
- Steep to overhanging walls
- Extend to base of continental slope, 3500 meters (11,500 feet) below sea level
- Carved by **turbidity currents**

### Turbidity Currents

- Underwater avalanche of muddy water and rock
- Sediment from continental shelf
	- Moves via gravity
	- Deposited at slope base
- **Turbidites**
	- Graded bedding
	- Fining upward

### Continental Rise

- Deposits generate **deep-sea fans (submarine fans)**
- Transition between continental and oceanic crust
- Distal ends of fans become flat abyssal plains

### Abyssal Plains

- Extend from base of continental rise
- Some of the deepest, flattest parts of Earth
- **Suspension settling** of very find particles
- Sediments cover ocean crust irregularities
- Well-developed in Atlantic and Indian oceans

#### Abyssal Plain Volcanic Peaks

- Below sea-level:
	- **Seamounts, tablemounts (guyots)**
		- At least 1 km (0.6 mile) above sea floor
	- **Abyssal hills**
		- Less than 1 km (0.6 mile) above sea floor

- Above sea-level:
	- **Volcanic islands**

### Ocean Trenches and Volcanic Arcs

- Convergent margins create **ocean trenches**
	- Deepest part of oceans
	- Most in Pacific Ocean - "Ring of fire"
	- **Mariana Trench**
		- Deepest part - **Challenger Deep** (11,022 meters)

### Island and Continental Arcs

- **Volcanic arc** on non-subducted ocean plate
	- **Continental arc**
		- Andes Mountains
	- **Island arc**
		- Japan

### Mid-Ocean Ridge

- Longest mountain chain
- Average 2.5 km (1.5 miles) above sea floor
- Divergent plate boundary
- Volcanic
	- Basaltic lava

#### Mid-Ocean Ridge Features

- **Rift Valley**
	- Down-dropped area on crest of ridge
	- Marked by fissures and faults
		- Small earthquakes

- **Seamounts** - tall volcanoes
- **Pillow lava** or **pillow basalt** - shapes formed when hot basaltic lava quickly cools

- **Hydrothermal Vents**
- Sea floor hot springs
- Foster unusual deep-ocean ecosystems able to survive without sunlight

### Hydrothermal Vents

- **Warm water vents**
	- Temperatures below 30 degrees celsius (86F)
- **White smokers**
	- Temperatures from 30-350 degrees celsius (86-662F)
- **Black smokers**
	- Temperatures above 350 degrees celsius (662F)
	- Color due to presence of metal sulfides

### Fracture Zones and Transform Faults along Mid-Ocean Ridges

- **Transform faults**
	- Offset section of mid-ocean ridge
		- Linear ridge on spherical Earth
	- Seismically active

- **Fracture zones**
	- Occur beyond transform
