## Intro to Planet Earth

### Overview

- The world ocean is the most prominent feature on Earth.
- Oceans cover 70.8% of Earth's surface.
- The origin and development of life on Earth are connected to the ocean.
- Oceans have a long history on Earth

### Earth's Oceans

Earth has one ocean divided into four principal oceans and one other:

#### Pacific

- World's largest and deepest ocean (accounts for more than half of Earth's ocean space)
	- Accounts for more than half of Earth's ocean space
- Earth's largest geographic feature
- Named in 1520 by Ferdinand Magellan

#### Atlantic

- Half the size of the Pacific
- Shallower than the Pacific
- Separates the Old World from the New World

#### Indian

- Smaller than the Atlantic
- Similar depth as the Atlantic
- Primarily in the Southern Hemisphere

#### Arctic

- Seven percent the size of the Pacific
- Shallowest world ocean
- Permanent layer of sea ice a few meters thick

#### Southern/Antarctic (Other)

- Circumnavigates Antarctica
- Actually parts of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian that lie south of 50 degrees S latitude

### Seas: What's the Difference?

- Smaller and shallower than oceans
- Usually enclosed by land
	- Sargasso Sea is surrounded by ocean currents
- Directly connected to the ocean
- Salt water

#### The Seven Seas

Before the 15th century, Europeans considered the seven seas to be the following:

- Red Sea
- Mediterranean Sea
- Persian Gulf
- Black Sea
- Adriatic Sea
- Caspian Sea
- Indian Ocean

though there are many more today.

### Comparing Oceans to Continents

- Average ocean depth is 3682 meters (12,080 feet)
- Average continental elevation is 840 meters (2756 feet)
- Deepest ocean trench is the Mariana Trench at 11,022 meters (36,161 feet)
	- Deepest part: Challenger Deep
- Highest continental mountain is Mt. Everest at 8850 meters (29,035 feet)

### Early Ocean Exploration

- Early explorers used boats to seek new fishing grounds for food
- The ocean facilitated trade and interaction between cultures.

#### Pacific Navigators

- No human evolution of Pacific islands
- Populated by voyagers
	- Polynesia
	- Melanesia
	- Micronesia
- Travel in open boats
- Required exceptional navigation skills
	- Difficult because islands are widely scattered

#### Pacific People

- No written records exist of Pacific human history before the 16th century
- Archeological evidence suggests island occupation by people from New Guinea as early as 4000-5000 B.C.
- In 1947, **Thor Heyerdahl** sailed on a balsa raft, which he named the Kon Tiki, to demonstrate migration of South Americans to Pacific Ocean islands

#### European Navigators

- **Phoenicians** - first from Western Hemisphere to develop navigation arts
  - Navigated circa 2000 B.C.
  - Explored Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, and Indian Ocean
  - First circumnavigated of Africa
  - Reached the British Isles

- Greek **Pytheas**
  - Sailed northward in 325 B.C.
    - Navigated using the North Star
    - Determined latitude by measuring the angle between the observer's line of sight to the North Star and the line to the northern horizon

- **Eratosthenes** - determined Earth's circumference
  - Used shadow of a column and simple geometry
  - 40,000 km
  - True 40,032 km (only 32 off!)

#### World Map Invention

- **Herodotus** produced inaccurate world map ~ 450 B.C.
- **Claudius Ptolemy** produced world map ~ 150 A.D.
  - Included continents: Europe, Asia, Africa
  - Also included lines of latitude and longitude
  - Updated, in error, Eratosthenes circumference estimate
    - Later caused Columbus to believe he had reached Asia

### The Middle Ages

- **Arabs** dominant navigators in the Mediterranean Sea
- Traded extensively with East Africa, India, and Southeast Asia
- Learned to use Indian Ocean seasonal monsoon winds for travel
  - Eastward during summer
  - Westward during winter

- **Vikings** explored North Atlantic Ocean
  - Settled Iceland and Greenland in 9th and 10th centuries A.D.
  - Leif Eriksson designated part of eastern Canada **Vinland** (now Newfoundland) in 995 A.D.
  - Greenland, Vinland settlements abandoned by 1450 A.D. due to climatic cooling

### The Age of Discovery in Europe (1492-1522)

- Search for new Eastern trade routes by sea
  - **Prince Henry the Navigator** of Portugal sought trade routes around Africa
  - Europeans explore North and South America
    - **Christopher Columbus** was financed by the Spanish to find new trade routes to Asia
    - "Discovers" Caribbean (San Salvador)

- **Ferdinand Magellan & Juan Sebastian del Cano**

	- Sailed for Spain to circumnavigate the globe
	- 5 ships with 280 sailors left Spain in 1519
	- Magellan killed on a Pacific island in 1521
	- Del Cano completed circumnavigation in 1522
	- 1 ship with 18 sailors survive

### Voyaging for Science

- Spain's maritime dominance ended when England defeated Spanish Armada in 1588
- English wanted to retain maritime superiority

#### Captain James Cook (1728-1779)

  - Undertook three scientific voyages
    - Ships HMS Endeavour, Resolution, Adventure
  - Used chronometer to find longitude
    - Mapped many islands in Pacific
  - First accurate maps of Earth's surface
  - Systemically measured ocean characteristics
    - Wind, current, subsurface water temperatures
    - Soundings - depth measurements
  - Cabbage in sauerkraut prevents scurvy
    - Vitamin C deficiency
    - Killed more sailors than anything else

### Oceanography Continues

- More high-technology tools available today
	- Sonar
	- Robotics
	- Computers
	- Satellites

- NOAA - National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration

#### What is Oceanography?

- Scientific study of all aspects of the marine environment, an interdisciplinary science

### Nature of Scientific Inquiry

- Natural phenomena governed by physical processes
- Physical processes similar today as in the past
	- "Principle of Uniformitarianism"

- Science assumes the natural world is **consistent** and **predictable**.

- Goal of science to
	- **discover patterns** in nature
	- use **knowledge** to **predict**

- Circular
- ALWAYS being tested
- New technology contributes additional information
	- Plate tectonics
	- Evolution

#### Theories and Truth

- Science never reaches _absolute_ truth
- Truth is _probable_ and based on available observations
- New observations yield scientific progress
- In reality, scientists have no formal method

- **Hypothesis** - tentative or untested explanation of an observation
- **Theory** - well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world

### Formation of Earth and the Solar System

#### Nebular Hypothesis

- **Nebular hypothesis** - all bodies in the solar system formed from nebula
	- **Nebula** - cloud of gases and space dust (mainly hydrogen and helium)
- Gravity concentrates material at the center of cloud (Sun)
- Protoplanets form from smaller concentrations of matter (eddies)

#### Protoearth

- Larger than Earth today
- Homogeneous composition
- Bombarded by meteorites
	- Moon formed from collision with large asteroid
- Radioactive heat
	- Spontaneous disintegration of atoms
	- Fusion reactions
- Heat from contraction (protoplanet shrinks due to gravity)
- Protoearth partially melts
- Density stratification (layered Earth)

#### Density Stratification

- High density = heavy for its size
- Early Earth experienced gravitational separation
	- High-density materials (iron and nickel) settled in core
	- Less dense materials formed concentric spheres around core

### Earth's Internal Structure

- Two "naming schemes":
	- Layers defined by
		- Chemical composition
		- Physical properties

#### Layers by Chemical Composition

- Crust
	- Low-density, mainly silicate minerals
- Mantle
	- Mainly iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg) silicate minerals
- Core
	- High-density, mainly iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni)

#### Layers by Physical Properties

- Lithosphere
- Asthenosphere
- Mesosphere
- Outer core
- Inner core

#### Lithosphere

- Cool, rigid shell
- Includes crust and upper mantle
- About 100 km (60 miles) thick
- Acts brittle
	- Broken into ~20 major plates

- Plate tectonics (more later)

#### Asthenosphere

- Relatively hot, plastic
- Flows with high viscosity
	- Allows movement of lithospheric plates
- Base of lithosphere to about 700 km (430 miles) deep

#### Continental vs. Oceanic Crust

|                                      | Oceanic Crust                          | Continental Crust                    |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Main rock type                       | Basalt (dark-colored igneous rock)<br> | Granite (light-colored igneous rock) |
| Density (grams per cubic centimeter) | 3.0                                    | 2.7                                  |
| Average thickness                    | 8 km (5 miles)                         | 35 km (22 miles)                     |

#### Isostatic Adjustment

- Vertical movement of Earth's crust
- Buoyancy of lithosphere on asthenosphere
	- Less dense continental crust floats higher than denser oceanic crust
- **Isostatic rebound** - rising of crust formerly weighed down by glacier ice

### Origin of Earth's Atmosphere

- **Outgassing** - occurred during density stratification
	- Water vapor
	- Carbon dioxide
	- Hydrogen
	- Other gases

- Earth's early atmosphere different from today
	- NO free oxygen!

### Origin of Earth's Oceans

- Outgassed water vapor fell as rain
- First permanent oceans formed 4 billion years ago
- Salinity developed from
	- Chemical weathering of continental rock
		- Early acidic rain dissolved more crustal minerals than today
	- Continued volcanic outgassing

#### Ocean Life Origin

- Earth's earliest know life forms are 3.5-billion-year-old bacteria fossilized in ocean rock
- Building blocks for life on early Earth

### Oxygen

- Humans require O$_{2}$
- Ozone (O$_{3}$) protects from ultraviolet radiation
- Early Earth had little free oxygen
	- Therefore, locked protective ozone layer
- The lack of ozone may have helped originate life

### Stanley Miller's Experiment

- Organic molecules formed by ultraviolet light, electrical spark (lighting), and a mixture of water, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, methane, and ammonia
- **Importance:** Proved that life could have originated on Earth using available gases, lightning, and UV radiation

### Evolution and Natural Selection

- Organisms adapt and change through time
- Advantageous traits are naturally selected
- Traits are passed to the next generation
- Organisms adapt to environments
- Organisms can modify environments

### Plants and Animals Evolve

- **Heterotrophs**
	- Very earliest life
	- Require external food supply
	
- **Autotrophs**
	- Evolved later
	- Manufacture own food supply

#### First Autotrophs

- Likely similar to modern **anaerobic** bacteria (survive without oxygen)
- **Chemosynthesis** from chemicals at deep hydrothermal vents
	- Supports idea of life's origins on deep ocean floor in absence of life

#### Photosynthesis and Respiration

- Complex autotrophs developed **chlorophyll**
- This allowed the use of Sun for **photosynthesis**
	- CO$_{2}$ + H$_{2}$ $\to$ sugar + O$_{2}$

- **Cellular respiration**
	- sugar + O$_{2}$ $\to$ CO$_{2}$ + H$_{2}$O

### Great Oxidation Event

- 2.45 billion years ago
- Increased oxygen and ozone eliminated the anaerobe food supply
- Light and oxygen kill anaerobes
- Cyanobacteria adapted and thrived

### Changes to Earth's Atmosphere

- Photosynthetic organisms are responsible for life as we know it today
- Reduce CO$_{2}$, increase O$_{2}$ to 21%
- High oxygen = biodiversity increase
- Low oxygen associated with extinction events

### Age of Earth

- **Radiometric age dating**
- Spontaneous decay of radioactive isotope
- Half-life - time required for $\frac{1}{2}$ of radioactive parent isotope to decay to stable daughter isotope
- Earth is about 4.6 billion years old
