## Beaches, Shoreline Processes, and the Coastal Ocean

### Defining Coastal Regions

- General features
	- **Nearshore** - extends seaward from low tide shoreline to low tide breaker line
	- **Offshore** - zone beyond low tide breakers
	- **Beach** - wave-worked sediment deposit of the shore area
	- **Wave-cut bench** - flat, wave-eroded
	- **Berm** - dry, gently sloping, elevated beach margin at the foot of coastal cliffs or sand dunes
	- **Beach face** - wet, sloping surface extending from berm to shoreline
	- **Longshore bars** - sand bars parallel to coast
		- May not always be present
		- Can cause approaching waves waves to break

### Composition of Beaches

- Locally available material
- May be coarse- or fine-grained sediment
	- Boulders from local cliffs
	- Sand from rivers
	- Mud from rivers
- Significant biologic material on tropical beaches
	- Example: coral reef material

### Sand Movement Along beach

- Perpendicular to shoreline (toward and away)
	- **Swash** - water rushes up the beach
	- **Backwash** - water drains back to the ocean
- Parallel to shoreline (up-coast or down-coast)
	- **Longshore current** - transports sand along the beach

### Summertime Beach

- Light wave activity
	- Wide, sandy berm
	- Steep beach face
	- Swash dominates
- Longshore bars not present
- Generally milder storms

### Wintertime Beach

- Heavy wave activity
	- Backwash dominates
	- Sediment moved away from shore
	- Narrower berm
	- Flattened beach face
- Longshore bars present
- Stormy weather

### Characteristics of Beaches Affected By Light and Heavy Wave Activity

|                      | Live wave activity                                           | Heavy wave activity                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Berm/longshore bears | Berm is built at the expense of the longshore bars           | Longshore bars are built at the expense of the berm<br>            |
| Wave energy          | Low wave energy (non-storm conditions)                       | High wave energy (storm conditions)                                |
| Time span            | Long time span (weeks or months)                             | Short time span (hours or days)                                    |
| Characteristics      | Creates summertime beach: sandy, wide berm, steep beach face | Creates wintertime beach: rocky, narrow berm, flattened beach face |

### Longshore Current

- Zigzag movement of water along shore
- Water current moves parallel to shoreline

### Longshore Drift

- Transports beach sediment in a zigzag fashion in the direction of the longshore current
- Occurs in surf zone
- Millions of tons of sediment moved yearly
- Direction of transport changes due to wave approach
- In general, net sediment transported southward along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the U.S.

### Rip Currents

- Develop when wave flow is perpendicular
	- Rip currents carry water from beach directly back to sea
	- Transports sediment away from shoreline
- Rip currents dissipate away from surf zone
- Narrow current
- If caught in rip, swim parallel to shore to remove yourself from the current

### Two Major Types of Shores

- **Erosional Shores**
	- Well-developed cliffs
	- Exist where tectonic uplift of coast
	- Example: U.S. Pacific Coast

- **Depositional Shores**
	- Gradually subsiding shore
	- Barrier islands and sand deposits are common
	- Example: U.S. Atlantic Coast

### Erosional Shores

- **Wave Refraction**
	- Water depth varies approaching coastline
	- Waves encountering irregular bottom are forced to bend
		- Portion of wave not meeting bottom move at same speed
		- Portion of wave meeting bottom is slowed down
	- Waves "curve in" toward shallows (**wave refraction**)
		- **Focuses erosional energy on headlands; deposit in bays**

- **Headlands** absorb much wave energy
- **Wave-cut cliffs** and **sea caves** are other features carved out by wave activity

### Erosional Shores

- **Sea arches** form where sea caves in headlands erode all the way through
- **Sea stacks** form when the tops of sea arches erode away completely

### Erosional Shorelines

- Uplift of wave-cut bench generates a **marine terrace**
- Wave erosion increases with
	- More shore exposed to open ocean
	- Smaller tidal range
	- Weaker bedrock

### Depositional Shorelines

- **Bay mouth bar (Bay barrier)**
	- Seals off lagoon from ocean
- **Spit**
	- Connects at one end to the mainland and hooks into a bay at the other
- **Tombolo**
	- Sand bar that connects island to the mainland
- **Barrier island**
	- Long offshore sand deposits parallel to coast
		- OBX

### Barrier Islands

- Long offshore deposits of sand parallel to coast
- Do not exist along erosional shorelines
- Protect mainland from high wave activity
- Separated mainland by lagoon

### Heavily Developed Barrier Island, Toms River, NJ

- Attractive building sites because of proximity to ocean
- Many structures destroyed by ocean or required relocation

### Barrier Islands

- More than 2000 barrier islands identified worldwide
- Almost 300 along Atlantic and Gulf coasts of U.S.
- Migrate landward over time
	- Due to rising sea levels
- Older peat deposits found on ocean beach

#### Barrier Island Features

- **Ocean Beach** - closest to the ocean
- **Dune** - stabilized by grasses; protect lagoon strong storms
- **Barrier Flat** - grassy area that forms behind dunes
	- Low marsh - mean sea level to high neap tide line
	- High marsh - extends to highest spring tide line

### Deltas

- Triangular deposits of sediment where rivers empty oceans or seas
- **Distributaries** - branching channels carry sediment to ocean
- Delta shoreline is smoothed when erosion exceeds deposition
- Nile River Delta eroding

### Beach Compartments

- Three major components:
	- Rivers that supply beach sediment
	- Beach
	- Offshore submarine canyons "drain" sediment from beach

- **Beach starvation** - human activities block supply of sand to beach compartments
	- Dams built along rivers
		- Prevent sediment from reaching beach
	- Hard stabilization such groins and breakwaters
		- Interrupt longshore drift (more later)

### Emerging Shorelines

- Shorelines above current sea level
- **Marine terraces** - flat platforms backed by cliffs

### Submerging Shorelines

- Shoreline below current sea level
- **Drown beaches**
- **Marshes**
- **Drowned river valleys**
	- **Estuaries**

### Changing Sea Level

- Two major processes can change sea level:
	- Local tectonic processes raise or lower Earth's crust
	- Worldwide (eustatic) changes in sea level

- **Tectonic Movements**
	- Include crustal uplift or subsidence at active plate margin
	- Example: The Pacific coast of the United States is currently being uplifted

- **Isostatic Adjustments**
	- Rebound of Earth's curst after removal of heavy loads of sinking with application of heavy loads
	- Ice loading from glaciers during ice ages

- **ustatic sea level changes** - worldwide
- Can be caused by
	- Formation or destruction of LARGE inland lakes
	- Sea floor spreading rate changes
	- Formation or melting of glaciers
	- Thermal expansion or contraction of seawater

### Pleistocene Epoch and Today

- From about 2 million to 10,000 years ago, a series of glacial events affected Earth
- At glacial maximum, sea level was at least 120 meters (400 feet) below today's sea level
- If all remaining ice on Earth melted today, sea level would rise another 70 meters (230 feet)

### Hard Stabilization

- Structures built to decrease coastal erosion and interfere with sand movement
- Also called armoring of the shore
- Often results in unwanted outcomes
	- Some structures may increase wave erosion

- Four major types of stabilization structures:
	- Groins and groin fields
	- Jetties Breakwaters
	- Seawalls

### Groins and Groin Fields

- Built perpendicular to the beach
	- Often made of **rip rap**, large blocky material
- Traps sand upcoast, which can cause erosion downstream of the longshore current

### Jetties

- Similar to groin
- Built in pairs perpendicular to shore
- Protects harbor entrances

### Breakwaters

- Built parallel to shoreline
- Designed to protect harbors from waves
- Can cause excessive erosion, requiring dredging to keep area stable

### Breakwater at Santa Monica, CA

- Between 1931 and 1949, breakwater disrupted longshore transport of sand

### Seawalls

- Destructive to environment
- Designed to armor coastline and protect human developments
- One large storm can. remove beach
- Wave activity eventually undermines seawall structure; need continual repair or will collapse

### Alternatives to Hard Stabilization

- Three major alternatives
	- **Construction restrictions**
	- **Beach replenishment**
	- **Relocation**

- **Construction restrictions**
	- Simplest alternative
	- Limit building near shorelines
	- Paradoxically, National Flood Insurance Program encouraged constructed

- **Beach replenishment**
	- Sand added to beach/longshore current
	- Expensive; costs between $5 and $10 per cubic yard
	- Sand must be dredged from elsewhere
		- Offshore bar?

- **Relocation**
	- Move structures rather than protect them in areas of erosion

### Estuaries and Human Activities

- **Chesapeake Bay**
	- Slightly stratified estuary
	- large seasonal changes in salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen
	- Maximum freshwater river flow in spring
	- Waters may become **anoxic** from May through August
	- Major kills of commercially important blue crabs, oysters, and other bottom-dwelling organisms
	- Increased nutrients from sewage and agriculture causing algal blooms and environmental issues

### Issues Facing Coastal Wetlands

- **Wetlands** - ecosystems with water table near surface
	- Generally saturated
	- Can be freshwater or coastal
- Coastal wetlands occur along margins of coastal waters, including estuaries, lagoons, marginal seas
	- Include swamps, tidal flats, coastal marches, and bayous

### Types of Coastal Wetlands

- **Salt marshes**
	- Between 30 and 65 degrees latitude
	- Support salt-tolerant grasses and other **halophytic** low-lying plants
	- Along many coasts

- **Mangroves**
	- Tropics below 30 degrees latitude
	- Salt-tolerant mangrove trees, shrubs, and palms
	- Tall tripod-life root systems
	- Caribbean, Florida, Southeast Asia

### Characteristics of Coastal Wetlands

- Home to diverse plants and animals
- Highly productive ecosystems
- Nurseries for more than half of commercially important fish species in southeastern U.S.

### Important of Coastal Wetlands

- Soak up nutrients that run off farmlands
- Remove inorganic nitrogen compounds and metals from environment
- Protect shorelines from erosion
- Dissipate coastal wave energy
- Absorb excess water
