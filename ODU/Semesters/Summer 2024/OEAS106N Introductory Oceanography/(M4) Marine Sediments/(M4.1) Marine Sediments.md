### Classification of Marine Sediments


![](./Resources/classification_of_marine_sediments_table.png)

- Classified by origin
	- **Lithogenous** - derived from land
	- **Biogenous** - derived from organisms
	- **Hydrogenous** or **Authigenic** - derived from water
	- **Cosmogenous** - derived from outer space

#### Lithogenous Sediments

- Eroded rock fragments from land
- Also called **terrigenous**
- Reflect composition of rock from which derived
- Produced by **weathering**
	- Breaking of rocks into smaller pieces

- Small particles eroded and transported
- Transported to ocean by
	- Streams
	- Wind
	- Glaciers
	- Gravity
- Greatest quantity around continental margins

- Reflect composition of rock from which derived
- Coarser sediments closer to shore
- Finer sediments farther from shore
- Mainly mineral **quartz** 9 (SiO$_2$)

#### Grain Size

- One of the most important sediment properties
- Proportional to **energy** of transportation and deposition
- Classified by **Wentworth scale of grain size**

![](./Resources/wentworth_scale_of_grain_size_table.png)

#### Texture and Environment

- Texture indicates environmental energy
- High energy (strong wave action)
	- Larger particles
- Low energy
	- Smaller particles

- Larger particles closer to shore

#### Sorting

- Measure of grain size uniformity
	- Well-sorted - all same sized particle
	- Poorly sorted - different sized particles

- Indicates selectively of transportation process

### Sediment Distribution

- **Neritic**
	- Shallow-water deposits
	- Close to land
	- Dominantly lithogenous
	- Typically deposited quickly

- **Pelagic**
	- Deeper-water deposits
	- Finder-grained sediments
	- Deposited slowly

#### Neritic Lithogenous Sediments

- **Beach deposits**
	- Mainly wave-deposited quartz-rich sands

- **Continental shelf deposits**
	- Relict sediments 3000-7000 years old
		- Current river deposition in estuaries

- **Turbidite deposits**
	- Graded bedding

	- Transported by deep ocean currents
	- Wind-blown dust

- **Abyssal Clay**
	- At least 70% clay sized particles from continents

#### Biogenous Sediment

- Hard remains of once-living organisms

- Two major types:
	- **Macroscopic**
		- Visible to naked eye
		- Shells, bones, teeth
	- **Microscopic**
		- Tiny shells or **tests**
		- Biogenic **ooze**

- Mainly algae and protozoans

#### Biogenous Sediment Composition

- Two most common chemical compounds:
	- **Silica** (SiO$_2$ or SiO${_2}~\cdot$nH$_2$O)
	- **Calcium carbonate** (CaCO$_3$)

#### Silica in Biogenous Sediments

- **Diatoms**

### Distribution of Biogenous Sediments

- Depends on three processes:
	- Productivity
		- Number of organisms in surface water
	- Destruction
		- Skeletal remains (tests) dissolve at depth
	- Dilution
		- Deposition of other sediments decreases percentage of biogenous sediments

### Pelagic Deposits Pt. 2

- Siliceous ooze
- Accumulates in areas of high productivity
- Silica tests no longer dissolved by seawater when buried by other tests

### Neritic Deposits Pt. 2

- Dominated by lithogenous sediment, may contain biogenous sediment
- **Carbonate Deposits**
	- Carbonate minerals containing CO$_3$
	- Marine carbonates primarily **limestone**
		- CaCO$_3$
	- Most limestones contain fossil shells
		- Suggests biogenous origin
	- Ancient marine carbonates constitute 25% of all sedimentary rocks on Earth

### Carbonate Deposits

- **Stromatolites**
	- Fine layers of carbonate
	- Warm, shallow-ocean, high salinity
	- Cyanobacteria
- Lived billions of years ago
	- Modern stromatolites live near Shark Bay, Australia

### Calcareous Ooze

- Warm, shallow ocean saturated with CaCO$_3$

- Cool, deep ocean undersaturated with CaCO$_3$
	- **Lysocline** - depth at which a _significant_ amount of CaCO$_3$ begins to dissolve rapidly

- CCD - **Calcite compensation depth**
	- Depth where CaCO$_3$ readily dissolves
	- Rate of supply = rate shells dissolve
	- ~4500 meters

#### Calcareous Ooze and the CCD

- Scarce calcareous ooze below 5000 meters (16,400 feet) in modern ocean
- Ancient calcareous oozes at greater depths if moved by sea floor spreading
	- AND covered by abyssal clay or SiO$_2$ ooze
