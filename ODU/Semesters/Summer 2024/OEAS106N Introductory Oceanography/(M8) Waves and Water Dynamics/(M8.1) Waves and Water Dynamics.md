## Waves and Water Dynamics

### Overview

- Most waves are wind-driven
- Most waves are generated by storms
- Waves transmit energy across the ocean surface
- Deep water and surf zone waves have different characteristics
- Tsunami are special fast, long waves generated by seismic events

### Wave Generation

- **Disturbing force** causes waves to form
	- Wind blowing across ocean surface
	- Interface of fluids with different densities
		- Air - ocean interface
			- **Ocean waves**
		- Air - air interface
			- **Atmospheric waves**
		- Water - water interface
			- **Internal waves**

### Internal Waves

- Associated with pycnocline
- Larger than surface waves
- Caused by tides, turbidity currents, winds, ships
- Possible hazard for submarines

### Wave Movement

- Waves transmit energy
	- "energy in motion"
- Cyclic motion of particles in ocean
	- Particles may move
		- Up and down
		- Back and forth
		- Around and around

### Progressive Waves

- **Progressive waves** oscillate uniformly and progress without breaking
	- **Longitudinal**
	- **Traversal**
	- **Orbital**

### Wave Terminology

- **Crest**
- **Trough**
- **Still water level**
	- Zero energy level
- **Wave height (H)**
- **Wavelength (L)**


### Orbital Wave Characterstics

- **Wave steepness** = H/L
	- If wave steepness > $\frac{1}{7}$, wave breaks
- **Wave period** (T) = time for one wavelength to pass fixed point
- **Wave frequency** = inverse of period or $\frac{1}{T}$


### Circular Orbital Motion

- Wave particles move in a circle
- Waveform travels forward
- Wave energy advances

### Orbital Wave Characteristics

- Diameter of orbital motion decreases with water depth
- **Wave base** = $\frac{1}{2}$L
	- Depth where orbital movement of water particles stops

### Deep-Water Waves

- If water depth is greater than wave base ($\geq \frac{1}{2}$L), wave is a **deep-water wave**
	- All wind-generated waves in open ocean
- **Wave speed (S)** = wavelength (L)/period (T)

- Lack of orbital motion at depth useful for floating runways and other structures
	- Constructed so most of mass is below wave base

### Shallow-Water Waves

- Water depth (d) is less than $\frac{1}{2}$ L
	- Water "feels" seafloor
- Wave speed (S) is proportional to depth
	- $S\left( \mathrm{\frac{meters}{\sec}} \right)=3.13~\sqrt{ \mathrm{d \times meters)} }$

- Wind-generated waves in shallow nearshore areas
- Tsunami
- Tides
- Particle motion flat elliptical orbit

### Transitional Waves

- Characteristics of both deep- and shallow-water waves
- Wave speed depends on both water depth and wavelength

### Wind-Generated Wave Development

- Windows blow over ocean surface, creating pressure and stress
	- **Capillary Waves**
		- Ripples
		- Wind generates initial stress on sea surface
	- **Gravity Waves**
		- Increasing wave
		- Wavelengths greater than 1.74

### Sea

- **Sea**
	- Where wind-driven waves are generated
	- Factor affecting wave energy
		- Wind speed
		- Wind duration
		- Fetch - distance over which wind blows

### Wave Height

- Directly related to wave energy
- Wave heights usually less than 2 meters (6.6)
- Breakers called whitecaps form when wave reaches critical steepness
- **Beaufort Wind Scale** describes appearance of sea surface

### Maximum Wave Heigh

- _USS Ramapo_ (1933): 152-meters (500 feet) long ship caught in Pacific typhoon
- Waves 34 (112 feet) high
- Previously thought could not exceed 60 feet

### Wave Energy

- **Fully developed sea**
	- Equilibrium condition
	- Waves can grow no further

- **Swell**
	- Uniform, symmetrical waves that travel outward form storm
	- Long crests
	- Transport energy long distances

### Swells

- Longer wavelength waves travel faster and outdistance other waves
	- **Wave train** - a group of waves with similar characteristics
	- **Wave dispersion**- sorting of waves by wavelengths
	- **Decay distance** - distance over which waves change from choppy sea to uniform swell

- Wave train speed $\frac{1}{2}$ speed of individual wave

### Wave Interference Patterns

- Collision of two or move wave systems from different storms
- **Constructive interference**
	- In-phase wave trains with about the same wavelengths
	- Wave heights increase
- **Destructive interference**
	- Out-of-phase wave trains with about the same wavelengths
	- Wave heights decrease
- **Mixed interference**
	- Most common
	- Wave heights complex pattern

### Rogue Waves

- Massive, spontaneous, solitary ocean waves
- Reach abnormal heights, enormous destructive power
- Difficult to forecast
- Occur more near weather fronts

### Waves in Surf Zone

- **Surf zone** - zone of breaking waves near shore
- **Shoaling water**
	- Gradually shallowing water as wave approaches coast
		- As deep-water waves encounter shoaling water less than $\frac{1}{2}$ their wavelength, they become transitional waves

### Waves Approaching Shore

- As a deep-water wave becomes a shallow-water wave:
	- Wave speed decreases
	- Wavelength decreases
	- Wave heigh increases
	- Wave steepness (height/wavelength) increases
	- When steepness $\geq \frac{1}{7}$ wave breaks

### Breakers in Surf Zone

- Surf as swell from distant storms
	- Waves break close to shore
	- Uniform breakers
- Surf generated by local winds
	- Choppy, high energy, unstable water
- Shallow water waves
- Three types of breakers:
	- Spilling
	- Plunging
	- Surging

### Spilling Breakers

- Gently sloping sea floor
	- Wave energy expended over long distance
- Water slides down front slope of wave

### Plunging Breakers

- Moderately steep sea floor
	- Wave energy expended over shorter distance
- Curling wave crest 

### Surging breakers

- Steepest sea floor
	- Energy spread over shortest distance
- Waves break on shore

### Wave Refraction

- Waves rarely approach shore at $90\degree$ angle
- Bending of wave crest as it approaches shore
	- Shallow water "feels bottom"
- Different segments of the crest travel at different speed

- Wave energy unevenly distributed on shore
- **Orthogonal liens** draw perpendicular to wave crests
	- Energy focused on headlands
	- Energy dissipated in bays

- Gradually erodes headlands
- Sediment accumulates in bays

### Standing Waves

- Two waves with same wavelength moving opposite directions
- Water sloshes back and forth
- Nodes
	- Not vertical movement
- Antinodes
	- Maximum vertical movement
- More on this in Tides chapter

### Tsunami

- Seismic sea waves
- Originate from sudden sea floor topography change
	- Earthquakes - _most common cause_
	- Underwater landslides
	- Underwater volcano collapse
	- Underwater volcanic eruption
	- Meteorite impact - **splash waves**

### Tsunami Characteristics

- Long wavelengths (> 200 km or 125 miles)
- Behaves as a shallow-water wave
	- Regardless of ocean depth
	- Can pass undetected under boats in open ocean
- Speed proportional to water depth
	- Very fast in open ocean
		- > 400 mph

### Tsunami Destruction

- Sea level can rise up to 40 meters (131 feet) when a tsunami reaches shore

### Tsunami Warning System

- **Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC)** - Honululu, HI
	- Uses seismic wave recordings to forecast tsunami
- **Deep Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART)**
	- System of buoys
	- Detects pulse of tsunami passing

### Tsunami Watches and Warnings

- **Tsunami Watch** - issued when potential for tsunami exists

- **Tsunami Warning** - unusual wave activity verified
	- Evacuate people
	- Move ships from harbors

### Waves as Source of Energy

- Lots of energy associated with waves
- Mostly with large storm waves
	- How to protect power plants
	- How to produce power consistently

- Environmental issues
	- Building power plants close to shore
	- Interfering with life and sediment movement

### Wave Power Plant
