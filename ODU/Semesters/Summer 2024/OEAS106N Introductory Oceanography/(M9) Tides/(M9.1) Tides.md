## Tides

### What Are Tides?

- **Tides** - periodic raising and lowering of ocean sea level throughout oceans of the world
- Occur daily
- Knowledge of tides is important:
	- Coastal activities
		- Surfing
		- Fishing
		- Navigation
		- Storm prep.

### Gravitational Forces

- **Gravitational force** is derived from **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation**
	- Every object that has mass in the universe is attracted to every other object

- Greatest force at **zenith**
	- Closest to moon
- Least force at **nadir**
	- Furthest from moon and opposite zenith

### Centripetal Force

- "Center-seeking force"
- Keeps planets in orbit via gravitation attraction
- Tethers Earth and Moon to each other


### Resultant Forces

- Tide-generating force results from gravitational force and centripetal force

### Tide-Generating Forces

- **Lunar bulges**
	- Result when force pushes water into two bulges
		- One toward Moon
		- One away from Moon

### Tidal Phenomena

- **Solar day** - 24 hours
- **Lunar day**
	- Time between two successive overhead moons
		- 24 hours, 50 minutes
	- High tides are 12 hours and 25 minutes apart
- **Tidal period** - time between high tides

### Tidal Bulges - Sun's Effect

- **Solar tidal bulges**
- Similar to lunar bulges but less than half the size
	- Sun is farther away than moon; less influence

### Earth's Rotation and Tides

- **Flood tide** - water moves toward shore; rising
- **Ebb tide** - water moves away from shore; dropping
- Tidal bulges are fixed relative to the Sun's and Moon's positions
	- Earth's rotation moves geographic locations into bulges

### Monthly Tidal Cycle

- **New Moon** - Moon between Earth and Sun, cannot be seen from Earth
- **Full Moon** - Moon and Sun opposite
- **Quarter Moon** - Moon appears half lit

- Other Moon phases
	- **Waxing crescent** - Moon moving from new to first quarter
	- **Waxing gibbous** - Moon moving from first quarter to full
	- **Waning gibbous** - Moon moving from full to last quarter
	- **Waning crescent** - Moving from last quarter to new moon

- **Tidal range** - difference between high and low tides
- **Spring tides** 
	- New or full moons
	- Tidal range greatest
- **Neap tides**
	- Quarter moons
	- Tidal range least

### Idealized Tide Prediction

- Two high tides/two low tides per lunar day
- Six lunar hours between high and low tides

### Tidal Patterns

- **Diurnal**
	- One high tide/one low tide per day
- **Semidiurnal**
	- Two high tides/two low tides per day
	- Tidal range about same
- **Mixed**
	- Two high tides/two low tides per day
	- Tidal range different
	- Most common

### Tides in Coastal Waters

- **Standing Waves**
	- Tide waves reflected by coast
	- Amplification of tidal range
	- **Bay of Fundy** in Nova Scotia
		- World's largest tidal range

- **Tidal Bores**
	- Tide-generating wall of water
	- Moves up certain rivers
- Conditions needed for tidal bores
	- Large spring tidal range of at least 6 m (20 ft)
	- Abrupt flood tide and short ebb tide phases
	- Low-lying river with seaward current
	- Shallowing of landward sea floor

### Coastal Tidal Currents

- **Flood current**
	- Water rushes up a bay or river with incoming tide
- **Ebb current**
	- Water drains from bay or river as tide goes out
- **High slack water** 
	- Peak of each high tide no current motion
- **Low slack water**
	- Peak of each low tide with no current motion

- **Whirlpool**
	- Rapidly spinning seawater
	- Restricted channel connecting two basins with different tidal cycles
	- _Maelstrom_ near Arctic Norway

### Tides and Marine Life

- **Grunion** spawning
	- Small silvery fish
	- Come out of water in California to spawn
	- Spawn only after higher high tide has peaked on the three or four nights following the highest spring high tide

### Tide-Generated Power

- Tides can be trapped one of 2 ways
	- Tidal water trapped behind coastal barriers in bays and estuaries turns electrical turbines
	- Tidal currents in narrow channels turn underwater turbines

- Does not produce power on demand
- Possible harmful environmental effects
- Renewable resource

### Power Plant at La Rance, France

- Successfully producing tidal power since 1967
- Potential usable tidal energy increase with increasing tidal range
