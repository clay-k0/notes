## Four Equivalent Statements

### Theorem 2.15

If $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ nonsingular matrices then $AB$ is also nonsingular and $(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}$

### Theorem 2.16

If $A$ is nonsingular matrix then

1. $A^{-1}$ is also a nonsingular matrix and $(A^{-1})^{-1}=A$
2. $A^{T}$ is also a nonsingular matrix and $(A^{T})^{-1}=(A^{-1})^{T}$

### Four Equivalent Statements

For all $n \times n$ matrix $A$, the following statements are equivalent:

1. $A$ is nonsingular
2. $A$ is row equivalent to $I_{n}$
3. For every $n$-vector $\vec{b}$, the system $A \vec{x}= \vec{b}$ has a unique solution
4. The system $A \vec{x}= \vec{0}$ has only the trivial solution

### Four Equivalent (Negative) Statements

For an $n \times n$ matrix $A$, the following statements are equivalent:

-1. $A$ is singular
-2. $A$ is not row equivalent to $I_{n}$
-3. For some $n$-vector $\vec{b}$, the system $A \vec{x}= \vec{b}$ has either no solution or many solutions
-4. The system $A \vec{x} = \vec{0}$ has nontrivial solutions

- - -

For a nonsingular matrix $A$,

$$
A \vec{x} = \vec{b}
$$

yields

$$
\underbrace{A^{-1}A}_{I} \vec{x} = A^{-1} \vec{b}
$$

and

$$
\vec{x}=A^{-1} ~\vec{b}
$$


Conclusion: A linear system with a nonsingular coefficient matrix can be solved by multiplying the inverse of the coefficient matrix by the right-hand side vector.
