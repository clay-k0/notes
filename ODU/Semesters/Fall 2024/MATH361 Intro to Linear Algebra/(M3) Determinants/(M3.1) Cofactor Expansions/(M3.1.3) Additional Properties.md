## Additional Properties

### Theorem 3.9

Let $E$ be an elementary $n \times n$ matrix

1. If $E$ corresponds to the operation $k~row_{i} \to row_{i}$ then $\det E = k$
2. If $E$ corresponds to the operation $row_{i}+k~row_{j} \to row_{i}$ then $\det E = 1$
3. If $E$ corresponds to the operation $row_{i} \leftrightarrow row_{j}$ then $\det E = -1$
4. If $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix then $\det(EA)=\det E \det A$

### Theorem 3.10

Let $A$ be a square matrix. $\det A=0$ if and only if $A$ is singular

### 5 Equivalent Statements

Recall the [[(M2.3.3) Four Equivalent Statements]]. We can add one more: 

For an $n \times n$ matrix $A$, the following statements are equivalent:

1. $A$ is nonsingular
2. $A$ is row equivalent to $I_{n}$
3. For every $n$-vector $\vec{b}$, the system $A \vec{x} = \vec{b}$ has a unique solution
4. The system $A \vec{x} = \vec{0}$ has only the trivial solution
5. $\det A \neq 0$

### 5 Equivalent Negative Statements

Likewise, we can do the same for the negative statements:

1. $A$ is singular
2. $A$ is not row equivalent to $I_{n}$
3. For some $n$-vector $\vec{b}$, the system $A \vec{x} = \vec{b}$ has either no solution or many solutions
4. The system $A \vec{x} = \vec{0}$ has only nontrivial solutions
5. $\det A = 0$

### Theorem 3.11

For all $n \times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$, $\det(AB)=\det A \det B$

### Corollary 3.12

If $A$ is a nonsingular matrix then $\det A^{-1}=\frac{1}{\det A}$
