## Rank

Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix:
- The subspace of $R^m$ spanned by the $n$ columns of $A$ is called the _column space_ of $A$.
	- Its dimension is said to be the _column rank_ of $A$.
- The subspace of $R^n$ spanned by the $m$ (transposed) rows of $A$ is called the _row space_ of $A$.
	- Its dimension is said to be the _row rank_ of $A$.

### Example 1 (Column Rank)

$A=\begin{bmatrix}1&-1&0&1 \\ 2&-2&1&1 \\ 3&-3&1&2\end{bmatrix}$

r.r.e.f.:

$\begin{bmatrix}\boxed{1}&-1&0&1 \\ 0&0& \boxed{1} &-1 \\ 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}$

Recall from a previous example, leading columns (1 and 3) of $A$ form a basis for the column space of $A$.

By the definition above, we can say we have 2 leading columns in the basis, meaning the _column rank_ of $A$ is 2.

### Theorem 4.22

If matrices $A$ and $B$ are row equivalent then _row space_ of $A$ = _row space_ of $B$.

### Theorem 4.23

The nonzero rows of a matrix in a r.e.f. (or r.r.e.f.) are linearly independent.

### Example 1 Revisited (Row Rank)

$A=\begin{bmatrix}1&-1&0&1 \\ 2&-2&1&1 \\ 3&-3&1&2\end{bmatrix}$

r.r.e.f.:

$\begin{bmatrix}\boxed{1}&-1&0&1 \\ 0&0& \boxed{1} &-1 \\ 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}$

The nonzero rows must be linearly independent and span the row space. In this case, the nonzero rows (1 and 2) satisfy this and therefore form a basis.

We have 2 nonzero linearly independent rows in the basis, meaning the _row rank_ is 2.

As we can see, when the matrix is in r.r.e.f., the column rank indicates how many leading columns there are, while the row rank indicates how many nonzero rows there are.

Generally, we expect the column rank and row rank to be equivalent in the same matrix. We can state this using Theorem 4.24:

### Theorem 4.24

column rank $A$ = row rank $A$

We will refer to this as simply _rank_, where the rank of a given matrix $A$, denoted by rank $A$, is the number _equal_ to both the _column rank_ of $A$ and the _row rank_ of $A$.
