## Subspace Definition, Examples

### Subspaces

If $V$ is a vector space with the given operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication, and $W$ is a subset of $V$ that satisfies the conditions:

1. $W$ contains the zero vector of $V$,
2. $W$ is closed under the operation of vector addition, and
3. $W$ is closed under the operation of scalar multiplication, 

then $W$ is called a _subspace_ of $V$.

### Theorem 4.5

If $W$ is a subspace of a vector space $V$ then $W$ is also a vector space

### Example

Is $W=\{ \begin{bmatrix}x \\ 2x\end{bmatrix}~|~x \in R\}$ a subspace of $R^2$?

**Solution:**

**Condition 1**: $W$ contains the zero vector of $V$ satisfied?

Is $\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$ in $W$?

$0=2 \cdot 0$

Therefore, the condition is _satisfied_

**Condition 2**: $W$ is closed under the operation of vector addition satisfied?

Given two vectors in $W$: $\vec{u}=\begin{bmatrix}x \\ 2x\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}y \\ 2y\end{bmatrix}$, their sum $\vec{u}+\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}x \\ 2x\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}y \\ 2y\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}x+y \\ 2x+2y\end{bmatrix}$

$2x+2y=2(x+y)$

Therefore, the condition is _satisfied_

**Condition 3**: $W$ is closed under the operation of scalar multiplication satisfied?

Given a vector in $W$: $\vec{u}=\begin{bmatrix}x \\ 2x\end{bmatrix}$ and a real number $c$, the scalar multiple $c \vec{u}=c \begin{bmatrix}x \\ 2x\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}cx \\ (c)(2x)\end{bmatrix}$ is in $W$ since $(c)(2x)=2(cx)$

Therefore, the condition is _satisfied_ and $W$ is a subspace of $R^2$

### Example 2

Is $W=\{ \begin{bmatrix}x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ x_{1} x_{2}\end{bmatrix}~|~x_{1},x_{2}~ \in R\}$ a subspace of $R^3$?

**Solution:**

Let's jump straight to the third condition:

**Condition 3**: $W$ is closed under the operation of scalar multiplication satisfied?

Given a vector in $W$: $\vec{u}=\begin{bmatrix}x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ x_{1} x_{2}\end{bmatrix}$ and a real number $c$, the scalar multiple $c \vec{u}=c \begin{bmatrix}x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ x_{1} x_{2}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}c x_{1} \\ c x_{2} \\ c x_{1} x_{2}\end{bmatrix}$.

The third component must equal to the product of the first and second components:

$c x_{1} x_{2} \neq (c x_{1})(c x_{2})$

Therefore, the condition is _not_ satisfied, meaning $W$ is _not_ a subspace of $R^3$

### Example 3

Is $W=\{ \begin{bmatrix}a&0&0 \\ 0&0&1\end{bmatrix}~|~a \in R\}$ a subspace of $M_{23}$?

**Solution:**

**Condition 1**: $W$ contains the zero vector of $M_{23}$

Is $\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0 \\ 0&0&0\end{bmatrix}$ in $W$? _No!_

Therefore, the condition is _not_ satisfied, meaning $W$ is _not_ a subspace of $M_{23}$
