## The Beginning

### Object Oriented Programming & Design

Let's first begin discussing S.O.L.I.D. Because we're learning about this straight away, let's split the word into two sub-acronyms and focus on _S.O._:

$$S.O.L.I.D.~=~(S.O.)~+~(L.I.D.)$$

### S.O What?

Why start with _S.O._? Well, we have all the tools we need to understand it:

- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle

Also, these naturally emerge out of how we write code. We aim to write reusable functions and classes and want to be able to extend those classes without modifying the underlying code.

Think about Rust's `std::vec::Vec` and `Iterator` or Python's `list`, `Iterator`, and `Generator`. Looking at their implementations under the hood demonstrates these ideas.

### Is There More?

Throughout the course, we will discuss best practices, design principles, design patterns, and mechanics that will allow us to build complete, reusable, and extensible ADTs.

These discussions will include the discussion of S.O.L.I.D. and D.R.Y. We will cover design patterns with the following foci:

- Iterators
- the Factory Pattern
- the Builder Pattern
- the Strategy Pattern

### Tools of the Trade

In this course we will use many tools, including…

### Lecture Examples

Most lectures will be based on the [Review (recorded lecture) Examples](https://github.com/cstkennedy/cs330-examples). 
The commit history can be found [here](https://github.com/cstkennedy/cs330-examples/commits/master).

### Why [insert language here]?

1. We are continuing with Java out of familiarity.
2. We will reference C++ based on its similarity to Java.
3. We will learn Python because you will have a S.O.L.I.D. (get it? puns!) foundation (and Python is fun).
4. We will discuss Rust since it provides a different perspective (and Rust is fun).
