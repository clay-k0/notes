## PEP 20 - The Zen of Python

### The Zen of Python

Python maintains a set of Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), and right now, our main focus is PEP 20. It states the following:

> [!Quote]
> 1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
>2. Explicit is better than implicit.
>3. Simple is better than complex.
>4. Complex is better than complicated.
>5. Flat is better than nested.
>6. Sparse is better than dense.
>7. Readability counts.
>8. Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.
>9. Although practicality beats purity.
>10. Errors should never pass silently.
>11. Unless explicitly silenced.
>12. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
>13. There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.
>14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.
>15. Now is better than never.
>16. Although never is often better than _right_ now.
>17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.
>18. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
>19. Namespaces are one honking great idea – let’s do more of those!

### Helpful Python Libraries

| Operation                               | Built-in Python Module |
| :-------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Working with zip files                  | `import zipfile`       |
| Working with gzipped files              | `import gzip`          |
| Reading, writing, or generating JSON    | `import json`          |
| Converting objects to JSON              | `import json`          |
| Serializing objects and data structures | `import pickle`        |
| Working with time                       | `import time`          |
| Working with dates and time             | `import datetime`      |
| Working with SQLite                     | `import sqlite3`       |
| Using advanced command line arguments   | `import argparse`      |

For third-party libraries, we'll use `pip` and a `requirements.txt` file.
