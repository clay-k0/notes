## Course Overview

To begin this course, we will briefly discuss the basics of Python 3 with particular emphasis on how **PEP 8** and **PEP 20** apply to Object Oriented Programming Languages (e.g., C++, Python, Java, and Rust). We'll also learn why we'll be comparing Python to such languages, as well as the _S.O._ in _S.O.L.I.D._
