## Main Course Themes Overview

### OO in Programming and Design

In this course we'll learn about object-oriented programming (OOP), design (OOD), and analysis (OOA). We keep mentioning OO, but what is truly meant by "object-oriented"?

### Observations on Pre-OO Programming Languages

- OO programming and design have their roots in _simulation_
- Simula (1967) programming language introduced objects & classes to describe the physical world being simulated.

#### The Roots of OOP

- The majority of programmers in the late 1960s came from other fields like mathematics or physical sciences rather than computer science. 
- Academic programs in CS were rare, and people often viewed CS a tool rather than a field
- A CS degree program offered two tracks - business programming and scientific programming
- Simulation became an active and exciting application area, leading to programmers recognizing common patterns throughout their code. 
	- Many code libraries were designed and distributed to simplify these simulation tasks

> [!Example] **Example in Pascal:** A pre-OOP basic library system simulation:
>
> ```pascal
> program LibrarySystem;
> 
> type
>   Book = record
>     title: string[50];
>     author: string[50];
>     available: boolean;
>    end;
>    
> var
>    library: array[1..100] of Book;
>   
> procedure CheckOutBook(bookId: integer);
>    begin
>       library[bookId].available := false;
>    end;
>   
> procedure ReturnBook(bookId: integer);
> begin
> 	library[bookId].available := true;
> end;
> 
> begin
>   // Example usage
>   CheckOutBook(1);
>   ReturnBook(1);
> end.
>```
>
> This record-based design groups related data but lacks the encapsulation and behavior modeling found in OOP.


> [!Info]
> Dominant languages at the time were application-specific:
> - FORTRAN and APL for science applications
> - COBOL for business
> - LISP for A.I., SNOBOL for text/string processing
>   
> **Note:** these languages could've been used for other applications, but it was easier to use a language that worked well with the application area.

[Simula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula) (1967) is renowned as the ultimate special purpose simulation language. While programmers naturally had to write simulations, the language allows programmers to organize a simulation program in terms of a world of _objects_ that interacted with one another via programmed behaviors.

#### Tension in Pre-OO Programming Languages

Programming language and design history is a battle against growing software complexity:

| Problem: too many … | Response                                      | Useful?             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| … statements        | nesting ( { … } )                             | OK                  |
|                     | gather statements into functions              | OK                  |
| … functions         | nesting                                       | inadequate          |
|                     | gather functions into subsystems / “modules”  | Too loosely defined |
|                     | gather functions into encapsulated ADTs       | Good                |
| … ADTs              | Gather into namespaces/packages               | Not much help       |
|                     | Organize loosely into inheritance hierarchies | The OO approach     |

> [!Example] **Example in Pascal:** Addressing complexity by grouping procedures:
>
> ```Pascal
> program LibrarySystem;
> 
>type
>  Book = record
>    title: string[50];
>    author: string[50];
>    available: boolean;
>  end;
>
>procedure CheckOutBook(var book: Book);
>begin
>  book.available := false;
>end;
>
>procedure ReturnBook(var book: Book);
>begin
>  book.available := true;
>end;
>
>type
>  Account = record
>    name: string[50];
>    borrowedBooks: integer;
>  end;
>
> procedure BorrowBook(var acc: Account);
> begin
>   acc.borrowedBooks := acc.borrowedBooks + 1;
> end;
>
> procedure ReturnBookToAccount(var acc: Account);
> begin
>   acc.borrowedBooks := acc.borrowedBooks - 1;
> end;
>
> begin
 > // Example usage
> end.

> Unlike in OOP, functions and structs are organized into modules, but there’s no encapsulation or clear relationships between data and behavior.

- The earliest way to bear increasing program size was to group individual statements into functions/procedures/subroutines.
- This concept was introduced much sooner than high-level languages, being implicit in the machine code instructions sets of all CPUs.
- When there became too many functions to manage, programmers grouped them into modules or subsystems, but these groupings were often a matter of documentation.
- The introduction of Abstract Data Typers (ADTs) brought a more solid organizing principle, grouping a data type name and a collection of functions for manipulating data of that type.
	- ADTs led to clean, reusable modules, however, they could be compromised by disobliging team members
- Languages like Modula 2 (1970) and Ada (1983) introduced language mechanisms (modules and packages) to enforce encapsulation and information hiding
### Pre-OO Design Techniques

#### Stepwise Refinement & Top-Down Design

- Stepwise refinement is the most fundamental design technique, often using pseudocode.
- It involves starting with a single statement that describes a desired behavior and iteratively breaking it down into more intricate steps.

> [!Example] **Example in Pascal:** Stepwise refinement for managing a library system:
> 
> ```pascal
> program LibrarySystem;
> 
>type
>  Book = record
>    title: string[50];
>    author: string[50];
>    available: boolean;
>  end;
>
>type
>  Account = record
>    name: string[50];
>    borrowedBooks: integer;
>  end;
>
>procedure CheckOutBook(var book: Book; var acc: Account);
>begin
>  if book.available then
>  begin
>    book.available := false;
>    acc.borrowedBooks := acc.borrowedBooks + 1;
>  end;
>end;
>
>procedure ReturnBook(var book: Book; var acc: Account);
>begin
>  book.available := true;
>  acc.borrowedBooks := acc.borrowedBooks - 1;
end;
>
>begin
>  // Example usage
>end.
>
> ```
> 
> The pseudocode shows a refined implementation, where each step is defined with more detail.

This example could be divided into subsystems like `RecordStorage`, `CheckInOut`, `AccountMgmt`, and `InventoryMgmt`.

Procedures such as the following would be grouped under each subsystem
	- `CheckOutBook`, `RenewBook` under `CheckInOut`
	- `addBook`, `removeBook` under `InventoryMgmt`

### Where are all the ADTs?

- ADTs are often seen as a set of organization principles, and they play a big role in pre-OO design
- Examples of general-purpose data structures are stacks, lists, etc.

### The Object-Oriented Philosophy

#### Program = Simulation

- The idea that a program simulates a model of the real world supports the OO philosophy

#### Simulation == Modeling

- Simulation can be viewed as a form of modeling, where objects represent real-world entities

### Putting the "Programming" in OOP

#### What is an Object?

- An _object_ is an encapsulation of data and behavior that interacts with other objects through defined interfaces.

#### Messages & Methods

- Objects communicate with one another by sending messages, which invoke methods that define the object's behavior

#### What is a Class?

- A _class_ defines the blueprint for creating objects, specifying their data structure and behavior.

#### What makes a PL an OOPL

- A programming language is object-oriented if it supports the concepts of _encapsulation_, _inheritance_, and _polymorphism_.
