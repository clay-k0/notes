## Pre-Phase 0

- This 'phase' focuses on normal, day-to-day operations and a typical Army support mission for a stability and support operation as part of a combatant command's theatre security cooperation plans (TRSCP)
- TSCP, during peacetime, must operate and defend the network
  - Its associated systems, and the data resident on or in transit across the network
- Establishing the public-private partnerships required to secure the commercial segments
  - Operations occur while undergoing nearly continuous attacks and penetration attempts due to the nature of cyberspace
- Combatant command may also deploy forces for a variety of operational activities 
  - From nation building and counter-narcotics activities to foreign internal defense, and non-combatant evacuation operations
