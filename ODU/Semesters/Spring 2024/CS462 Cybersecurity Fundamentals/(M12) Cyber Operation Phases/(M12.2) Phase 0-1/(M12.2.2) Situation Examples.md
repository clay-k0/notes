## Situation Examples

- Nation-states and other adversaries attempt to penetrate friendly networks to gain an information advantage and focus their cyberspace capabilities on collecting information about friendly interests, plans, technical data, and intentions.
- A large technologic peer-competitor and other adversaries also seek to determine U.S. and coalition efforts to support a host nation that has requested assistance in providing stability and support during actions by hostile neighbouring country
  - These initial threat activities include attempted physical and cyber penetration and attempted disruption of hose nation water and electric services
- As a crisis emerges, and an additional threat is added within the combatant commander's area of responsibility, the resources used to conduct day-to-day enduring operations are still required
  - Additional resources are likely to be required to provide support for each crisis as it emerges, surging forces and resources based on the commander's requirements, priorities, and intent
