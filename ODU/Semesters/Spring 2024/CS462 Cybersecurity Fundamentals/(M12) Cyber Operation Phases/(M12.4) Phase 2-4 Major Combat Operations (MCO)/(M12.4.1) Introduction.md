## Introduction

Operational and tactical cyber operation capabilities required to _support MCO_ with _simultaneous stability operations_

- **Situation:**
	- Joint forces conducting offensive operations
	- Civil support operations a success
- **Mission:**
	- The Army, in concert with its unified action and coalition partners, will conduct full spectrum operation (FSO) to defeat the military and other adversary forces of the neighboring hostile nation/state that are occupying portions of host nation
- **Threat Actions:**
	- Adversaries will conduct CyperOps against targets worldwide, supported by sympathetic hackers inspired by the hostile force's information campaign
		- Cyber attacks from the neighboring hostile nation/state forces may decrease, but attacks from criminal and outside elements (hacker unions and others rallying to the adversary cause) will likely increase

The adversary, using CyberOps capabilities for command and control, fundraising, recruiting, and otherwise fostering an insurgent environment, supporting, and recruiting criminal activity in cyberspace against banking and commercial sites as criminal elements seek to exploit the current chaotic situation in the host nation, and continuing the use of CyberOps capabilities to support their overall information strategy.

- CyberOps support for the mission:
	- Joint and Army CyberOps capabilities will support all aspects of the commander's plan for FSO
	- CyberOps will provide CyberSA and overall SA for the commander in a dynamic and distributed battlefield
	- CyNetOps capabilities will be dynamic due to distributed, simultaneous operations that accompany battle command on the move
	- Organic and support element CyberWar capabilities will be used to gain and protect advantage and place adversaries at a disadvantage
	- Responsive CyberSpt capabilities will be required to adapt to a thinking enemy that tailors advanced technologies to its objectives
