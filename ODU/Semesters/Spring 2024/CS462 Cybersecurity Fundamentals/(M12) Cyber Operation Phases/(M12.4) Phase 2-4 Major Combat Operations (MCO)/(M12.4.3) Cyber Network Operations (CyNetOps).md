## CyNetOps

- Must be flexible and agile during combat
- CyNetOps capabilities will be provided from the joint to the battalion and possibly lower echelons
- Protecting the CyNetOps advantage is critical in phases 2, 3, and 4 because of the critical battle command and other capabilities that rely on CyNetOps capabilities
- U.S. and coalition forces use CyNetOps capabilities to enable battle command on the move, distributed operations, and stability operations
    - While preparing to operate in a degraded CyberOps condition
- Assigned and attached cyber planners and integrators at echelons from battalion through the joint force will plan, prepare, execute, and assess the effectiveness of CyberOps in support of MCO and stability operations
- During phase 4, CyNetOps enhancements will result in a more robust infrastructure
    - For example, commercialization
    - Freeing up forces for other tasks
    - Preparing for the transition to phase 5.
- CyberSA becomes more dynamic and complex due to the nature of operations during phases 2, 3, and 4.
    - The adversary will be taking many deception actions to situation data
