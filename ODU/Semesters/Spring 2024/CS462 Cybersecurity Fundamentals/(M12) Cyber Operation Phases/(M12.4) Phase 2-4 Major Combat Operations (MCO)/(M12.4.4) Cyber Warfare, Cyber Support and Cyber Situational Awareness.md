## Cyber Warfare (CyberWar)

- This is the first time that CyberWar attacks on tactical target embedded processors and controllers in equipment, systems, and infrastructure are conducted to disadvantage the adversary

- CyberWar and enabling capabilities will exploit and attack
    - Computer and telecommunication networks
    - Embedded processors and controllers in equipment, systems, and infrastructure,
    - In accordance with appropriate authorities in support of the commander's objectives
    - During manuvering, a different blend of CyberWar and enabling capabilities will be employed
        - Due to the responsiveness and authorities under which each is conducted.

- Coordinated access to exploit adversary systems and networks

- Following friendly tactical operations, exploitation may be employed to gather adversary target or battlefield damage assessment information
    - To effectively accomplish this, recurring physical and remote access to adversariesâ€™ hardware and so"ware is required

- DCyD will be emphasized in phases 2, 3, and 4 due to the fluid nature of the operations and due to the dynamic nature of CyNetOps, defense in depth will be absolutely critical.

## Cyber Support (CyberSpt)

- Cyber aspects of site exploitation, forensics, mitigation and remediation, and responsive RDT&E capabilities are the initial CyberSpt capabilities that support MCO and stability operations

- As stability operations become more prevalent, vulnerability and security assessments will increase in importance

## Cyber Situational Awareness (CyberSA)

- CyberSA is a challenge to establish and maintain during the dynamic operations of phases 2, 3, and 4
    - They are absolutely critical to the commander can make informed decisions

- The simultaneous execution of phases 2, 3, and 4 also dictates that adequate analysis and understanding is developed
    - As the majority of the force transitions to phase 4 and prepares for phase 5.
