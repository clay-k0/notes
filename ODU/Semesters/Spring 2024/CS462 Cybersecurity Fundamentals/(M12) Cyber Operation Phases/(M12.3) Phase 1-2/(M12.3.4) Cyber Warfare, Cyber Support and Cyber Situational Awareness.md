## Cyber Warfare, Cyber Support and Cyber Situational Awareness

### Cyber Warfare (CyberWar)

- Initially to focus on exploitation and dynamic cyber defense
- Later to include cyber attacks to deny adversary any chance of disruption in achieving mission goals
- CyberWar planning activities may include "pre-planned, on-call" priority missions as part of the overall concept of operations
- To support the defense in depth, dynamic cyber defense integrated with cyber network operations

### Cyber Support (CyberSpt)

- This requires a robust RDT&E to stay at cutting edge of technology
- Partnering with internal, Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies
  - This helps to support the pursuit and investigation of criminal organizations and independent hackers working against friendly forces
- Penetration testing and red, blue, green teams are used for vulnerability and security testing
- The unit legal officer provides the commander with an assessment of all CyberWar targets and actions within the confines of the ROE and all relevant U.S., host nation, and international laws

### Cyber Situational Awareness (CyberSA)

- CyberSA challenges during Phase 1 and 2
  - The CyNetOps is very dynamic during force deployment
  - CyberWar capabilities take time to fully develop an understanding of adversarial and other specified cyberspace
- To rapidly develop and maintain CyberSA, the following is needed:
  - Close coordination and partnership between the operating and generating forces, public/private stakeholders, and Army
  - Unified action
  - Multinational partners
- The staff cyber planner and integrator will be responsible for the fusion of friendly, adversarial, and other specified cyberspace SA into a single, coherent picture to ultimately support the commander's decision-making process
