## Force Deployment

- This transition focuses on the strategic and operational CyberOps capabilities required
  - For force deployment, the initial introduction of forces into the theatre, and simultaneous civil support operations
- **Situation:** A friendly host nation has requested U.S. and United Nations assistance to deter and defend them from a neighbouring hostile nation/state
  - US systems under attack to delay support
  - The SECDEF has tasked the DOD to conduct civil support operations to protect both physical and cyber critical infrastructure
- **Mission:** The primary focus of CyberOps during phases 1 and 2 is on assuring freedom of action and access to theatre infrastructure so follow-on forces can seamlessly flow into the area of operations.
- CyberOps support for the mission
  - Normal enduring continental U.S. and forward base cyber activities continue
- CyberOps planners now must surge and deploy from their assigned units through ARFORCYBER
  - The theatre ASCC to their supported units at echelons from the theatre combatant commands to forces possible as low as the BCT based on JTF task organization and priorities
- These planners will augment and support all aspects of the commander's deployment planning and execution cycle
  - CyberOps will provide CyberSA and overall SA for the commander
  - CyberNetOps capabilities will be critical for seamless force deployment and immediate employment upon arrival in theatre
  - CyberWar capabilities will enable an operational advantage
  - CyberSpt capabilities will be tailored to the commander's mission to provide responsive support to both CyberNetOps and CyberWar activities
