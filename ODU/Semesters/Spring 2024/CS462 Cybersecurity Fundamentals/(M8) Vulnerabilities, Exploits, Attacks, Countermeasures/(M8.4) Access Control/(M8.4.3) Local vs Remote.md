### Local Access
- Local access can be assured to be from trusted machines

### Remote Access
- Remote access involves an external network connection
	- The external network connection can be unsafe
- A secure connection should be required for remote access
- Layer 2 and layer 3 virtual private network (VPN) can be used
	- A VPN creates a secure tunnel between an origination and destination point
	- IPsec tunneling model can be used for a layer 3 tunnel for remote access
	- Both Cisco and Microsoft have a layer 2 tunneling protocol (L2TP) that can be used for setting up a Virtual Private Dial-up Network (VPDN)
