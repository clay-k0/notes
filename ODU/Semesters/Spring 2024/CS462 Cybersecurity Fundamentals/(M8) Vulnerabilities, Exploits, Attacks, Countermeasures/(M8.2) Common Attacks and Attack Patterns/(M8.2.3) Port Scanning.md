Although port scanning is not necessarily a DoS attack, it is a method that can be used to check for vulnerabilities.

Recall that the transport layer uses port numbers to help identify the process where packet should be delivered. Also recall that there are standard port numbers associated with well-known applications. For instance, port 80 is HTTP and port 23 is the telnet protocol.

A list of well-known TCP and UDP port numbers can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers).

If an attacker knows that a certain application has a vulnerability, they may use a port scanner to find computers that are running that application and listening for connections on a particular port. Once they find it, this computer may become the target for an attack.

The [nmap](https://nmap.org/) is a well-known port scanner, originally developed in 1997. It is also used by security professionals to perform security audits on their systems.

One of the nice things nmap includes is a list of [security tools](http://sectools.org/).
