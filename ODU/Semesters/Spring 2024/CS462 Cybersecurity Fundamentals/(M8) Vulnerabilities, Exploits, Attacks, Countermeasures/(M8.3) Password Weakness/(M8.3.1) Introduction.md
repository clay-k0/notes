Password weakness concerns the end user; the number of passwords managed is always increasing.
- User resorts to using duplicated passwords, password memo, passwords with common themes, serial passwords (using 1, 2, 3 with the same password), etc.
- Some OS allow no password to make it easier for the user

Sophisticated tools for password cracking are easily accessible:

**CAIN:**
- A tool originally designed to recover passwords, can be used for attack by a hacker
- Uses multiple ways to recover a password (looking into packets, brute force methods, hash comparison tables, etc.)

**John the Ripper**: Uses multiple hash and cryptanalytical methods
- For all major OSs (John the Ripper Pro can be purchased for money)

Other password cracking tools include **L0phtcrack, Ophcrack, Hashcat, and Aircracking-ng**
