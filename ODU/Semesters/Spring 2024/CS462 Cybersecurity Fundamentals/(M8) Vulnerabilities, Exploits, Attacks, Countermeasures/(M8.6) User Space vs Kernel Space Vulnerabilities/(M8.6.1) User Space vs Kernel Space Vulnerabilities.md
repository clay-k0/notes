Privilege Escalation starts with the exploitation of a user space vulnerability
- A user is allocated a limited amount of memory in the user space
- A vulnerability
- By default, the execute permission includes the read permission
	- This results in a memory leak and a code leak in the user space in memory
	- This is ring 3 in contemporary ring-based memory management
- OS code, device drivers, memory management code are in the kernel
	- Also called ring 0
	- Kernel space execution requires high permission levels, such as full system privilege

Overwriting user or kernel memory starts with overwriting application or kernel process pointers
- The legit pointers are replaced with the ones that have malicious code
	- This could be exfiltration code, keyloggers, etc

The user applications need to access addresses for kernel processes
- To use OS software and device drivers
- To use IRQs
	- If an IRQ can be overwritten with a malicious code address (such as a keylogger), the malicious code will load

Many attacks, such as buffer overflow can occur in both spaces
