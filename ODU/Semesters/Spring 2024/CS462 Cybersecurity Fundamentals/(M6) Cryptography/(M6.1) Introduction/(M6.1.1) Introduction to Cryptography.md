### Cryptography
**Greek: "kryptos"**
- Hidden, secret

**Confidentiality**
- Especially with transport encryption

**Authentication and access control**
- I know it's you. I REALLY know it's you.

**Non-repudiation**
- You said it. You cannot deny it.

**Integrity**
- Tamper-proof

- - -
### Terminology
**Plaintext**
- An unencrypted message (in the clear)

**Ciphertext**
- An encrypted message

**Cipher**
- The algorithm used to encrypt and/or decrypt

**Cryptanalysis**
- The are of cracking encryption
- Researchers are constantly trying to find weaknesses in ciphers
	- A mathematically flawed cipher is bad for everyone

- - -
### Types

**Substitution Cipher (Caesar cipher)**
- Substitute one letter with another - ROT13
- "Uryyb Jbeyq" is "Hello World"

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| $\updownarrow$ | $\updownarrow$ | $\updownarrow$ | $\updownarrow$ | $\updownarrow$ | $\updownarrow$ | $\updownarrow$ | $\updownarrow$ | $\updownarrow$ | $\updownarrow$ | $\updownarrow$ | $\updownarrow$ | $\updownarrow$ |
| N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |

**Transposition Cipher**
- Keep the letters, change the order
- "HLOOLELWRD"

**Hack these ciphers with frequency analysis**
- Count the letters, numbers, and groups
- E, T, A, O

**Mechanical Cipher**
- Germany's Enigma machine (WWII)

**Mathematical Cipher**
- Use complex algorithms to encrypt

- - -
### Other Cryptography Topics
**Keys**
- Add the key to the cypher to really encrypt

**One-time pad**
- The plaintext was combined with a shared "pad" of text to produce the ciphertext
- The decryption would be done with the same pad of text
