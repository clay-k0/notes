- Collecting vulnerabilities of these systems 
- Trying to innovate some vulnerabilities
  - Hash signatures of critical processes can be created for malware
- Collected information on what security protocols and implementations will be deployed in the adversary network
- Encryption algorithms and their possible vulnerabilities
