**More Mature Domain-Specific Software Development Frameworks**
The goal of this approach is to promote the use (and reuse) of well-tested, well-analyzed code, and thus to reduce the incidence of exploitable vulnerabilities.

A mature domain-specific framework, once learned by software developers, can enable the quick production of programs that are well-tested from both a software perspective and from a domain knowledge perspective.

In the best case scenario, where a mature framework is wielded properly by experts, there is a substantial opportunity to avoid software mistakes the can result in exploitable vulnerabilities.
