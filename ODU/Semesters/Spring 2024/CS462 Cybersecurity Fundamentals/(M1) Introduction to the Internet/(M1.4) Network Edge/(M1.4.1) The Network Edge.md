We already discussed that computers and other devices connected to the Internet are referred to as **end systems**. They get the name end system because they sit at the edge of the Internet.

We also said that end systems are called **hosts**. They are often referred to as this for fact that they host (or run) application programs such as a Web browser browser program, a Web server program, an e-mail client program, or an e-mail server program.

It is important to remember that these terms will be used **interchangeably** as we move forward.

Now, hosts can also be further divided into two categories: **clients** and **servers**.

**Clients**:
- Desktop, Mobile PCs, smartphones, etc.
**Servers**:
* More powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, stream video, relay email, etc.
* Reside in large **data centers** (like Google)

### Access Networks
The access network is what physically connects an end system to the first router (the "edge router") on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.

#### Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up, and Satellite

**Digital Subscriber Line**:
- A household obtains it from the same local telephone company (telco) that provides its local phone access
- When used, a customer's telco is also their ISP
- A DSL modem uses the existing telephone line to exchange data with a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in the telco's local central office (CO).
- A DSL modem takes digital data and translates it to high-frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires to the CO, which are then translated back into digital format at the DSLAM
- The transmission rate actually received depends on the home's distance from the CO and the age of the home's telephone line
	- < 2.5 Mbps upstream transmission rate (typically < 1 Mbps)
	- < 24 Mbps downstream transmission rate (typically < 10 Mbps)

**Cable Internet Access**:
- Makes use of the cable television company's existing cable television infrastructure
- A household obtains it from the same company that provides its cable television
- Requires special modems called cable modems
- Uses the cable modem termination system (CMTS) like DSL uses DSLAM - it turns the analog signal sent from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format
- Shared broadcast medium
- HFC: hybrid fiber coax
	- asymmetric: up to 40 Mbps downstream transmission rate, up to 30 Mbps upstream transmission rate

**Fiber To The Home (FTTH**):
- Up-and-coming high-speed technology
- Provides an optical fiber path from the CO to the home
- Two competing optical technologies
	- Active Optical Network (AON)
	- Passive Optical Network (PON) - Verizon FIOS
* Much higher Internet rates
	* Down - 10-20 Mbps
	* Up - 2-10 Mbps
* Fiber carries television and phone services

**Satellite**
- Used in locations where DSL, cable, and FTTH are not available (e.g., in some rural areas)

**Dial-Up**
- A home modem connects over a phone line to a modem in the ISP

#### Enterprise Access: Ethernet & WiFi

**Ethernet**:
- Typically used in companies, universities, etc.
	- 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps transmission rates
	- End systems typically connect into Ethernet switch

**WiFi**:
- Shared wireless access network connects end system to router
- Wireless LANs
	- Radio spectrum replaces wire
	- Transmit to base station (access point), which is connect via wire
	- 100 feet

#### Wide-Area Access: 3G & LTE

- Access via cellular network
- Distance: 10s of kms
- Rates: 1-10 Mbps
- 3G, 4G: LTE
