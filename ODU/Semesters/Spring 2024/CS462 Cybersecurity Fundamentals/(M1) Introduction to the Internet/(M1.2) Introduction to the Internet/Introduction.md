Before diving into networking concepts, we need to establish some definitions

**Speed - bits per second (bps)**

* Kilo (K) = 10<sup>3</sub> = 1,000
* Mega (M) = 10<sup>6</sub> = 1,000,000
* Giga (G) = 10<sup>9</sub> = 1,000,000,000

**Capacity/Size - bytes (B)**

* Kilo (K) = 2<sup>10</sup> = 1,024
* Mega (M) = 2<sup>20</sup> = 1,048,576
* Giga (G) = 2<sup>30</sup> = 1,073,741,824

*Remember, 8 bits = 1 byte (8 b = 1 B)*

**Time - seconds (s)**

* milli (m) = 10<sup>-3</sup> = 0.001
* micro (Î¼) = 10<sup>-6</sup> = 0.000001


*Read Intro to Chapter 1 "Computer Networks and the Internet" in the textbook*

- What is 1,250,000 bps in Mbps?
	1250000/1000000 = 1.25 Mbps
- How many bytes are in 3 KB?
	3 * 1024 = 3072 bytes
- How many milliseconds are in 2.5 second
	2.5/0.001 = 2500 ms
