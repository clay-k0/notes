## Creating Strong Passwords

As we've seen earlier, one of the keys elements authentication is a user password. So, how can we create strong passwords that we might be able to remember? 

Well, there are _4_ methods we can use to create strong passwords:

| Method                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Schneider's Method                | Take a memorable sentence and transform it into a password by using, in order, the first letters of each word, numbers, and special characters.<br><br>Example: Convert "I love to eat pizza on Sundays!" to "ll2epoS!"   |
| Electrum Method                   | Create a password using a lengthy phrase made up of random words. This can be one using something like [xkcd Password Generator](http://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/)                                   |
| PAO (Person-Action-Object) Method | Uses mnemonic devices by forming an image in the mind with a person, an action, and an object which are then combined to from a password.<br><br>Example: "Einstein riding a bicycle on the Moon" might become "EiRiBiMo" |
| Phonetic Muscle Memory            | Use a password generator to generate phonetic structure and see which ones are easy to type.<br><br>Sample outputs might include: "vinalti", "drekalpo", "tumerso".                                                       |
