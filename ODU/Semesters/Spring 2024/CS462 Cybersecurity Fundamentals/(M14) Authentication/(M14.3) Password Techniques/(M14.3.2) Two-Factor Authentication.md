## Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication is pretty much what it sounds like. You provide one type of authentication (your password) and if you're connecting to the service from an IP address that is not recognized (a new computer or device), the service will try to contact you using other method. Typically this is done by sending a text message to a mobile device with a code for you to enter on the site. Even though it's not 100% secure -- someone could steal both your password and your phone, it is much more secure than if someone could access your data with only your password.
