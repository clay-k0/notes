## Authentication Overview

This module focuses on authentication and access instead of encryption. It is important to make sure that only authorized users are allowed access inside a network or access to certain machines.

Our textbook walks through a few iterations of an authentication protocol, pointing out security issues. For instance,

- AP1.0 - Alice sends her username in plaintext ("I am Alice")
- AP2.0 - Alice sends her username in plaintext from a known IP address
- AP3.0 - Alice sends her username and password in plaintext 
- AP3.1 - Alice sends her username in plaintext and her password encrypted with a shared (symmetric) key
- AP4.0 - Alice sends her username in plaintext, Bob replies with a word in plaintext, Alice replies with the word encrypted with a shared key
