## Single Sign-On

Kerberos is often used for single sign-on (SSO). The goal of SSO is to allow a user to authenticate once and use multiple services without having to re-authenticate. Google and Facebook provide single sign-on. There are several websites that allow you to authenticate with either your Google or Facebook credentials an use their service. One example is a to-do lost application called Remember the Milk (RTM),

You can register directly with RTM, or you can link your RTM account with your Facebook or Google credentials. If you do so and you are already logged in with Facebook or GooGle, you don't have to re-enter your username or password to login to RTM.
