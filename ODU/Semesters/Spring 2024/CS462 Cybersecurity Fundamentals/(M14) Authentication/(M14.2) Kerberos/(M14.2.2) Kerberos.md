## Kerberos
## Overview

Kerberos is a key distribution and authentication method used by very many operating systems. It uses a shared (symmetric) secret key. We'll see later that Kerberos can also be used for single sign-on operations (such as using your Facebook credentials to login to other services).

## Key Concepts
Recall the following definitions:
- **Symmetric Key:** A type of encrypted where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt information.
- **Mutual Authentication:** Both the client and server verify each other's identity to enhance security during the communication process.

## Notes From Professor Messer's Video

The following notes are from Professor Messer's [Kerberos Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpBCJ8vS7T0). 

### Kerberos

- **Protocol Type:** Network authentication protocol
- **Advantages:**
	- Authenticate once, then you're trusted by the systems
	- No need to re-authenticate to everything
	- Mutual authentication between the client and the server
		- Protect against man-in-the-middle or replay attacks
- **Historical Context:**
	- Standardized in the 1980s, developed at MIT
	- Defined in RFC 4120
	- Adopted by Microsoft starting with Windows 2000, based on Kerberos 5.0 open standard

### Kerberos Components: The Three Heads
The word Kerberos, or Cerberus, comes from the mythological three-headed dog of the underworld.

- **Key Distribution Center (KDC):**
	- Vouches for the user's identity
	- Runs on TCP/UDP port 88
- **Authentication Service (AS):**
	- Handles user authentication and network access
- **Ticket Granting Service (TGS):**
	- Issues tickets for accessing network services

### Kerberos Authentication Process

1. **Client Authentication**:
    
    - **Step 1**: Client sends a logon request to AS/KDC, encrypting the current date and time with the user's password hash.
    - **Step 2**: AS checks the timestamp; if within 5 minutes, it issues:
        - **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**: Contains client's name, IP, timestamp, and validity period, encrypted with KDC's secret key.
        - **TGS Session Key**: Used for communication with TGS, encrypted using the user's password hash.
2. **Client Service Authentication**:
    
    - **Step 1**: Client sends TGT and application server name to TGS, using a timestamp encrypted with the TGS session key.
    - **Step 2**: TGS returns a service session key and a service ticket (containing user info), both encrypted using a secret key shared with the application server.
    - **Step 3**: Client forwards the service ticket to the application server along with another timestamp encrypted with the service session key.
    - **Step 4**: Application server verifies both pieces of information, ensuring the message is intact and confirming the identity of the client.
