## Cookie Security

Because cookies are sent in plain text, someone using packet sniffing could capture a userâ€™s cookies. If a web site uses only a cookie as a login, the stolen cookie could be used to simulate the same session by manually setting the cookie. The server canâ€™t tell the difference between the original cookie and the stolen one, so it allows the attacker to access the userâ€™s information. This is called _session hijacking_.

Watch [this video](http://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-401/cookies-header-manipulation-and-session-hijacking-2/) for an overview of session hijacking using cookies. This video also includes a short demo.

### Video Notes
#### Browser Cookies and Session IDs

- Cookies
	- Information stored on your computer by the browser
- Used for tracking, personalization, session management
	- Not executable, not generally a security risk
		- Unless someone gets access to them
- Could be considered a privacy risk
	- Lots of personal data in there
- Session IDs are often stored in the cookie
	- Maintains sessions across multiple browser sessions

#### Session Hijacking (Sidejacking)

#### Header Manipulation

- Information gathering
	- Wireshark, Kismet
- Exploits
	- Cross-site scripting
- Modify headers
	- Tamper, Firesheep, Scapy
- Modify Cookies
	- Cookies Manager+ (Firefox add-on)

#### Prevent Session Hijacking

- Encrypt end-to-end
	- They can't capture your session ID if they can't see it
	- Additional load on the web server (HTTPS)
	- Firefox extension: HTTPS everywhere, force-TLS
- Encrypt end-to-somewhere
	- At least avoid capture over a local wireless network
	- Still in-the-clear for part of the jounrey
	- Personal VPON (OpenVPN, VyprVPN, etc.)
- Use Session ID monitors
	- Blacksheep
	- Application-specific

Related to XSS and session hijacking are Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This attack has users unknowingly issue malicious web requests once they are authenticated into a web service. Potential actions could range from transferring money (in a bank website) to changing the contact email address.
