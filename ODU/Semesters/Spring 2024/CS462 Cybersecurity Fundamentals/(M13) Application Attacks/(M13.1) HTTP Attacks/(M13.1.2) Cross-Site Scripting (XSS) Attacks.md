## Cross-Site Scripting

Notes from [this video](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-401/cross-site-scripting-2/).

**XSS:**
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are something else entirely
- Originally called cross-site because of browser security flaws
	- Information from one site could be shared with another
- One of the most common vulnerabilities
	- Complex and varied
- Malware that uses JavaScript
	- Bad guys gravitate towards JS because of what it allows them to do

### Non-Persistent (Reflected) XSS Attack

- Website allows scripts to run in user input
	- Search box is a common source
- Bad guy emails a link that takes advantage of this vulnerability
	- Runs a script that sends credentials/sessions IDs/cookies to the bad guy
- Script embedded in URL executes in the victim's browser
	- As if it came from the server
- Bad guys use credentials/session IDs/cookies to steal victim's information without their knowledge
	- Very sneakily

### Persistent (Stored) XSS Attack

- Bad guys posts a message to a social network
	- Includes the malicious payload
- It's now "persistent"
	- Everyone gets the payload
- No specific target
	- All viewers to the page
- For social networking, this can spread quickly
	- Everyone who views the message can have it posted to their page
		- Where someone else can view it and propagate it further

### "Samy Is My Hero" Attack

- October 4, 2005 - MySpace worm hits
	- Authored by Samy Kamkar
- Payload posted "but most of all, Samy is my hero" on a victim's profile
	- Viewing the post would plant the payload on their personal profile page
	- Added Samy as a friend
- 20 hours later, Samy had over one million friends
	- And a felony
- Plea agreement to a felony
	- Three years probation, 90 days community service, and restitutions
	- No computer use (revoked years later)
