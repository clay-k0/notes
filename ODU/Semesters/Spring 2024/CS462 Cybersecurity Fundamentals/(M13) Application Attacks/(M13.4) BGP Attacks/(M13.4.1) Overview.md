## BGP Attacks Overview

Because of BGP's role in enabling routing between ASes, it is a prime target for attack. The most common type of attack on BGP is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The basic idea is to overload routers with excessive numbers of BGP update messages or sending overly large route advertisements.
