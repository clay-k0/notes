## DNS Cache Poisoning

We’ve seen how important DNS is to the Internet, so it is a high-value target for attack. The attacks we’ll discuss are all based on cache poisoning. The basic idea behind DNS cache poisoning is that an attacker hears a DNS request and then sends DNS replies with bogus A and sometimes NS resource records that are then cached by the requester.

In 2008, security researcher Dan Kaminsky discovered “better” way to perform DNS cache poisoning. It involves sending many requests for a known non-existent hostname to a DNS server, thus giving the attacker time to poison the cache.
