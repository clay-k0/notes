### Offensive Cyber Operations

Unlike defensive cyber operations, which salvage your own systems from attacks and exploitation, offensive cyber operations are about attacks on adversary's systems. Offensive cyber operations entail two main strategies: cyber attacks and cyber exploitation.

**Cyber Attacks:**
- Cyber attacks aim to disrupt or destroy adversary systems
- Examples include Denial of Service (DOS) attacks and viruses hidden in trojan horses.

**Cyber Exploitation:**
- Cyber exploitation does not necessarily cause immediate disruption or destruction
- It often involves exploiting vulnerabilities, such as backdoors, to infiltrate adversary systems
- Launched code may remove its tracks and persist long-term, forming what is known as an _Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)_

Both types of offensive attacks exploit vulnerabilities, making them similar to military operations. Cyber attacks can be likened to the "use of force" to achieve political objectives, while cyber exploitations resemble clandestine operations, often employed for intelligence gathering.

Given their parallels to traditional military operations, offensive cyber operations fall in the scope of international laws``, including the United Nations' Law of War. This means that military cyber operations, whether categorized as "attacks" or "exploitations," are subject to legal frameworks governing armed conflict.
