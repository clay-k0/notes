### Step 2: Weaponization

Weaponization relates to preparing exploits to break through the vulnerabilities

- A key component for offensive operation preparation

- It sets the direction to be taken for the rest of the steps

- A knowledge of Operating System and its vulnerabilities can result in preparing or finding code written to exploit those
  - If the adversary is using OpenSSL and has not patched buffer overflow vulnerability called heart bleed, prepare a large input will make a weapon
    - It can be used to send memory contents

- Identifying a careless employee as a vulnerability and planning on using piggybacking as a weapon
  - Studying employees in/out schedule will be a reconnaissance in this case
