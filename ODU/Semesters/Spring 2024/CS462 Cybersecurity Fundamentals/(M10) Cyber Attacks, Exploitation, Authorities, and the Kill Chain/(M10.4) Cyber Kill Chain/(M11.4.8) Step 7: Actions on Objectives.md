### Step 7: Actions on Objectives

Actions on Objectives finally achieve the mission goals

- For the short-term or long-term
- Traffic sensing can provide network information
- File access can provide specific information
- File corruption can be done to render crucial files useless
- A complete coordinated failure of the entire network can be planned by creating a botnet for distributed DOS (DDOS)

Extended List of Actions and Objectives on adversary network:

1. Denial of service, including performance degradation
2. Collect and exploit information
3. Record network topology and usage
4. Look for specific information, e.g., for industrial espionage
5. Destruction of network data
6. Generate bogus traffic on the adversary network
7. Targeted altering of data in specific databases
