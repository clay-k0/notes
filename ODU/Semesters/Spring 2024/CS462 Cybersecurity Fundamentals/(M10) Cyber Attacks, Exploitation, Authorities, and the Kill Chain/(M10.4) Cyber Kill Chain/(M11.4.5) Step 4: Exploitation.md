Exploitation relates to gaining access to an adversary

- In social engineering using piggybacking, following the careless employee through a card controlled door

- Zero-day attack acquiring or creating

- In phishing attacks, the opening of malicious links or attachments
  - As soon as the adversary opens the attachment, a code segment gains access to critical Operating System components or adversary machine remotely

- Defense against this step can be the most challenges â€“ user training
  - Often carelessness can be self-interpreted as a courtesy.
  - Many people do not confirm the spoofed sender and are gullible to phishing
