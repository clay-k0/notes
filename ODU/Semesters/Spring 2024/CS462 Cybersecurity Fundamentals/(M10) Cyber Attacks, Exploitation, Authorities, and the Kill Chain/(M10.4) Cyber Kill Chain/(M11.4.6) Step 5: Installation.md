Installation pertains to establishing a beachhead in adversary land

- No disruption or destruction has to occur just a control and communication station is established

- Even a passive monitoring of traffic or important files can follow for a long time
  - Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) for the adversaryâ€™s situation

- Services and AutoRun keys, etc. can be added

- With privilege escalation and removal from process queue

- For social engineering using piggyback, a time-sensitive / recording device implantation is an example
