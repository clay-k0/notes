### Step 1: Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance relates to actions taken to identify vulnerable targets

- Open TCP/UDP ports, OS version, Applications on servers
  - Vulnerabilities can be injected too using prior vulnerabilities
  - Creating kernel level vulnerabilities from userland entry

- Vulnerabilities identified do not have to be software, hardware or protocols
  - Collecting email addresses, social media contacts, other mass media such as news about an organization or even what Internet provider someone subscribes to, are all valuable pieces of information for reconnaissance.

- Protection against reconnaissance a critical component of defense
