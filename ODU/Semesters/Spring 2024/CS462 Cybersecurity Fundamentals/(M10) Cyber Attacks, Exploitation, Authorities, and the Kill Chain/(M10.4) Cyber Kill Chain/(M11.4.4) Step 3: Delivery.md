### Step 3: Delivery

Delivery relates to an actual launching the exploit/weapon

- In OpenSSL case, sending the actual packet

- For a logical bomb, loading the resident component with the logical bomb
- The delivery can be direct or indirect
  - An exploit as an email attachment is an indirect delivery
  - A Sync flooding attack on TCP (DOS) is a direct delivery
  - A non-destructive process gaining kernel level access and downloading malware is a direct delivery

- Infecting a website with malware that adversary is likely to use
  - “Watering hole” phenomenon
