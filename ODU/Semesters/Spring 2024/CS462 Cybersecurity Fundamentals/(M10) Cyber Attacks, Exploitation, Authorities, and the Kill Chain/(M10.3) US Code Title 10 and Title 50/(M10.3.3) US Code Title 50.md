### US Code Title 50

Under Title 50, a “covert action” is subject to a presidential finding and Intelligence Committee notification requirements.

- 50 U.S.C. 3093 allows the President to authorize the conduct of a covert action if he determines such an action is necessary to support identifiable foreign policy objectives of the United States and is important to the U.S. national security, which determination shall be set forth in a finding that shall be in writing unless immediate action is required.

The question of whether Title 10 or Title 50 applies to offensive cyberspace operations has been of particular interest to Congress with respect to its oversight duties, as they are subject to different reporting.
