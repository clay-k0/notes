### Introduction to US Code Title 10 and Title 50

The US Department of Defense (DOF) views cyberspace just like any war domain (ground, air, space, or water). In this respect, the US Code Title 10 applies to cyber operations just like any military operation.

Two relevant statutes for Military Cyber Operations are:
1. **Title 10**, U.S. Code, Armed Forces, Section 111: Man, train, and equip US forces for military operations in cyberspace
2. **Title 50**, U.S. Code, War and National Defense, Section 3093: Secure US interests by conducting military and foreign intelligence operations in cyberspace
