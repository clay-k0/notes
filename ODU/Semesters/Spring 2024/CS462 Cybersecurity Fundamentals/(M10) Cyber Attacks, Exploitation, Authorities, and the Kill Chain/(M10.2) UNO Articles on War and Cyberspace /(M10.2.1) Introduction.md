### Relevance of Offensive Cyber Operations

Offensive cyber operations hold relevance across various international conditions, encompassing scenarios beyond traditional wartime conflicts.

**Non-War Cyber Relations:**
- Nations may engage in adversarial cyber relations despite not being in a state of war. This can stem from factors such as industrial competition or the absence of laws regulating hackers' activities.

**Cyber Conflicts in Various Arenas:**
- Cyberspace serves as a battleground reflecting ongoing conflicts between nations, both in terms of trade and military offensives across different domainsâ€”land, sea, air, and space.

**Spectrum of Relations:**
- There are a range of possibilities in between a friendly and an enemy relation

**Distinctiveness of Cyberspace:**
- Cyberspace stands out from other domains due to its unique characteristics and its varied nature of handling interactions

### Legal Framework

**Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC):**
- The Law of Armed Conflict serves as the primary legal framework used to govern the constraints on the use of offensive cyber operations. It establishes rules to regulate the conduct of involved parties in armed conflict.
