## What is Discrete Mathematics?

It is the part of mathematics that covers the study of discrete (rather than continuous) objects.

***Calculus*** deals with continuous objects and is **not** part of discrete mathematics. 

### Examples of Discrete Mathematics:

- Integers
- Steps taken by a computer program
- Distinct paths taken to travel from point A to B on a map along a road network
- Ways to pick a winning set of lottery numbers

### Discrete vs Continuous

| Term       | Meaning                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Discrete   | It is ***counted*** and examples include integers $\{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}$, rolling a dice $\{1, 2, 3, \dots, 6\}$ |
| Continuous | It is ***measured*** and examples include age, height, weight, length, ...                                                           |

### Problems Solved Using Discrete Mathematics

Discrete Mathematics has solved questions like:

1. How many valid Internet addresses are there?
2. How can we prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers?
3. What is the probability of winning a particular lottery?
4. How can I encrypt a message, so that no unintended recipient can read it?
