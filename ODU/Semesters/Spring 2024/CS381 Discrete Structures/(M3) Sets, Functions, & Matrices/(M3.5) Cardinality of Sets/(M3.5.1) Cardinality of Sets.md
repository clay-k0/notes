## Cardinality of Sets

**Definition:** The cardinality of a set $A$ is equal to the cardinality of a set $B$, denoted:

$$|A|=|B|$$

if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) from $A$ to $B$

If there is a one-to-one function (injection) from $A$ to $B$, the cardinality of $A$ is less than or equal to the cardinality of set $B$, which we write as

$$|A|\leq|B|$$

When $|A|\leq|B|$ and $A$ and $B$ have different cardinality, we say that the cardinality of $A$ is less than the cardinality of $B$ and write $|A|\leq|B|$,

A set that is either finite or has the same cardinality as the set of positive integers $\mathbb{Z}^+$ is called **countable**. A set that is not countable is **uncountable**,

The set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ is an uncountable set.

When an infinite set is countable (*countably infinite*) its cardinality is $\aleph_{0}$ (where $\aleph$ is aleph, the 1st letter of the Hebrew alphabet). We write $|S|=\aleph_{0}$ and say that S has cardinality "aleph null".

### Showing a Set is Countable Pt. 1

An infinite set is countable if and only if it is possible to list the elements of the in a sequence (indexed by the positive integers).

The reason for this is that a one-to-one correspondence $f$ from the set of positive integers to a set $S$ can be expressed in terms of a sequence $a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n},\dots$ where $a_{1}=f(1),a_{2}=f(2),\dots,a_{n}=f(n)$

### Hilbert's Grand Hotel
The Grand Hotel (example from David Hilbert) has countably infinite number of rooms, each occupied by a guest. We can always accommodate a new guest at this hotel. How?

**Explanation:** Because the rooms of the Grand Hotel are countable, we list them as Room 1, Room 2, Room 3, and so on. When a new guest arrives, we move the guest in Room 1 to Room 2, the guest in Room 2 to Room 3, and in general the guest in Room $n$ to Room $n+1$, for all positive integers $n$. This frees up Room 1, which we assign the new guest, and all the current guests still have rooms.

The hotel can also accommodate a countable number of new guests, all the guests on a countable number of buses where each bus contains a countable numbers of guests.

### Showing a Set is Countable Pt. 2 (Examples)

**Example 1**: Show that the set of positive even integers $\mathbb{E}$ is a countable set

**Solution:** Let $f(x)=2x$

$$1~~~2~~~3~~~4~~~5~~~6$$

$$\updownarrow~\updownarrow~\updownarrow~\updownarrow~\updownarrow~\updownarrow$$

$$2~~~4~~~6~~~8~~~10~~~12$$

This $f$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{E}$ since $f$ is both one-to-one and onto. To show that it is one-to-one, suppose that $f(n)=f(m)$. Then $2n=2m$, and so $n=m$. To see that it is onto suppose that $t$ is an even positive integer. Then $t=2k$ for some positive integer $k$ and $f(k)=t$.

**Example 2:** Show that the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable.

**SolutIon**: Can list in a sequence 
$0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,\dots$
Or can define a bijection from $\mathbb{N} to \mathbb{Z}$:
- When $n$ is even: $f(n)=\frac{n}{2}$
- When $n$ is odd: $f(n)=-\frac{n-1}{2}$

### Positive Rational Numbers are Countable

**Definition:** A *rational number* can be expressed as the ratio of two integers $p$ and $q$ such that $q\neq 0$
- $\frac{3}{4}$ is a rational number
- $\sqrt{ 2 }$ is not a rational number

**Example 3:** Show that the positive rational numbers are countable.

**Solution:** The positive rational numbers are countable since they can be arranged in a sequence:
$$r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},\dots$$
Here's how it's done:

### Strings

**Example 4:** Show that the set of finite strings $S$ over a finite alphabet $A$ is countably infinite

**SolutIon:** Show that the strings can be listed in a sequence. First, list
1. All strings of length 0 in alphabetical order
2. Then all strings of length 1 in lexicographic (as in a dictionary) order
3. Then all strings of length 2 in lexicographic order
4. And so on.
This implies a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ to $S$ and hence it is a countably infinite set.

### Set of All Java Programs is Countable

**Example 5**: Show that the set of all Java programs in countable

**Solution**: Let $S$ be the set of strings constructed from the characters which can appear in a Java program. Use the ordering from the previous example. Take each string in turn
- Feed the string into a Java compiler (this will determine if the input program is a syntactically correct Java program)
- If the compiler says yes, this is a syntactically correct Java program, thus we add the program to the list
- We move on to the next string

In this way, we construct an implied bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ to the set of Java programs. Hence, the set of Java programs in countable.

### Real Numbers are Uncountable

**Example**: Show that the set of real numbers is uncountable

**Solution:** The method is called the Cantor diagnalization argument, and is a proof by contradiction.
1. Suppose $\mathbb{R}$ is countable. Then, the real numbers between 0 and 1 are also countable (any subset of a countable set is countable)
2. The real numbers between 0 and 1 can be listed in order $r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},\dots$
3. Let the decimal representation of this listing be
	- $r_{1}=0.d_{11}d_{12}d_{13}d_{14}d_{15}d_{16}\dots$
	- $r_{2}=0.d_{21}d_{22}d_{23}d_{24}d_{25}d_{26}\dots$
	- $r_{3}=0.d_{31}d_{32}d_{33}d_{34}d_{35}d_{36}\dots$

### Computability

**Definition:** We say that a function **computable** if there is a computer program in some programming language that finds the values of this function. If a function is not computable we say it is **uncomputable**.

There are uncomputable functions. We shown that the set of Java programs in countable.
