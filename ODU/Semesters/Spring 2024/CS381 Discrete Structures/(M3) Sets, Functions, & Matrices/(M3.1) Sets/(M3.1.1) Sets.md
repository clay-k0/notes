## Sets

- A set is an unordered collection of objects
	- Examples include the students in this class, the chairs in the classroom, etc.
- The objects in a set are called **elements**, or **members** of the set
- The notation $a \in A$ denotes that $a$ is an element of the set $A$
- If an element does not belong to a set, we write it as $a \notin A$

### Describing a Set

**How do we a describe a set?**
1. **Roster** Method
2. **Set-Builder** Notation (Method)
3. **Interval** Notation (Method)

- - -
### Roster Method

- $S=\{a,b,c,d\}$

- Remember, a set is unordered, and therefore the order of elements is **not** important
	- $S=\{a,b,c,d\} =\{b,d,a,c\}$

- Listing an element more than once does not change the set
	- $S=\{a,b,c,d\} = \{a,b,c,b,c,d\}$

- Ellipses ($\dots$) may be used to describe a set without listing all elements
	- $S=\{a,b,c,d \dots, z\}$

**Examples**
- Set of all vowels in the English alphabet:
	- $V=\{a,e,i,o,u\}$

- Set of all odd positive integers less than 10:
	- $S=\{1,3,5,7,9\}$

- Set of all positive integers less than 100:
	- $S=\{1,2,3, \dots, 99\}$

- Set of all integers less than 0:
	- $S=\{\dots, -3, -2, -1\}$


**Important Sets**

| Symbol | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- |
| $\mathbb{Z}$ | Integers                $\{\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots\}$ |
| $\mathbb{Z}^+$ | Positive Integers  $\{1,2,3,\dots\}$ |
| $\mathbb{N}$ | Natural Numbers  $\{0,1,2,3,\dots\}$ |
| $\mathbb{Q}$ | Set of Rational Numbers |
| $\mathbb{R}$ | Set of Real Numbers |
| $\mathbb{R}^+$ | Set of Positive Real Numbers |
| $\mathbb{C}$ | Set of Complex Numbers |

### Set-Builder Notation

- Specify the property or properties that all members must satisfy:

**Examples:**
$S = \{x~|~x~is~a~positive~ integers~ less ~than ~100\}$
$O=\{x~|~x~is~an~odd~positive~integer~less~than~10\}$
$O=\{x \in Z^+~|~x~is~odd~and~x<10\}$

- A predicate can be used:
	- $S=\{x|P(x)\}$
	- For instance, $S=\{x~|~Prime(x)\}$

- - -

### Interval Notation

$[a,b] = \{x~|~a\leq x\leq b\}$
$[a,b) = \{x~|~a\leq x\lt b\}$
$(a,b] = \{x~|~a\lt x\leq b\}$
$(a,b) = \{x~|~a\lt x\lt b\}$

closed interval is denoted by $[a,b]$
open interval is denoted by $(a,b)$

### Universal Set and Empty Set

- The **universal** set $U$ is the set containing everything currently under consideration

- The **empty** set $\{~\}$ is the set with no elements
	- The symbol $\emptyset$ is used to denote an empty set

**Key Points to Remember**
- Sets can be elements of sets
	- $\{\{1,2,3\},a,\{b,c\}\}$
	- $\{\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q},\mathbb{R}\}$

- The empty set is different from a set containing the empty set
	- $\emptyset \neq \{\emptyset\}$

### Set Equality

**Definition:** Two sets are equal **if and only if** they have the same elements

- Therefore, if $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if: 

$$\forall x (x \in A \leftrightarrow  x \in B)$$

- We can write $A=B$ if $A$ and $B$ are equal sets

Examples:

- $\{1,3,5\}=\{3,5,1\}$
- $\{1,5,5,5,3,3,1\}=\{1,3,5\}$

- Using logical equivalences, we can also express $A=B$ as 

$$\forall x [(x \in A \to x \in B) \land (x \in B \to x \in A)]$$

- Which is equivalent to 

$$A \subseteq B~and~B \subseteq A$$
- - -

### Subsets

**Definition:** The set $A$ is a **subset** of $B$ if and only if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$

- The notation $A \subseteq B$ is used to denote $A$ is a subset of $B$
- $A\subseteq B$ only holds true if $\forall x (x \in A \to x \in B)$ is **true**

#### Proper Subsets
**Definition:** If $A \subseteq B$, but $A\neq B$, then $A$ is a **proper** subset of $B$ denoted by $A \subset B$

If $A\subset B$, then
$$\forall x (x \in A \to x \in B) \land \exists x (x \in B \land x \notin A)$$
is true

### Set Cardinality

**Definition:** The **cardinality** of a finite set $A$, denoted by $|A|$, is the number of distinct elements within $A$

**Examples:**
- $|\{1,2,3\}| = 3$
- Let $S$ be the letters of the English alphabet. Then, $|S|=26$
- $|\emptyset| = 0$
- $|\{\emptyset\}| = 1$
- The set of integers is infinite

- - -
### Power Sets

**Definition:** The set of all subsets of a set $A$, denoted by $\mathbb{P}(A)$, is called the power set of $A$.

**Example:**
If $A=\{a,b\}$, then $\mathbb{P}(A) = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a,b\}\}$

If a set has $n$ elements, then the cardinality of the power set is $2^n$

- - -
### Tuples

The ordered $n-tuple~(a_{1},a_{2}, \dots, a_{n})$ is the ordered collection that has $a_1$ as its first element and $a_2$ as its second element and so on until $a_{n}$ as its last element.

---
### Cartesian Product

**Definition:** The Cartesian Product of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \times B$ is the set of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ $$A \times B=\{(a,b)~|~a \in A \land b \in B\}$$
**Example:**
$$A=\{a,b\}~and~B=\{1,2,3\}$$
$$A \times B = \{(a,1),(a,2),(a,3),(b,1),(b,2),(b,3)\}$$

The Cartesian Product of the sets $A_{1},A_{2},\dots,A_{n}$ denoted by $A_{1} \times A_{2} \times \dots \times A_{n}$ is the set of ordered $n-tuples (a_1,a_2, \dots, a_n)$ where $a_i$ belongs to $A_1$ for $i=1, \dots n$
$$A_{1} \times A_{2} \times \dots \times A_{n} = (\{a_{1},a_{2}, \dots, a_{n})~|~a_{i} \in A_{i}~for~i=1,2, \dots, n\}$$
##### Problem:
What is $A \times B \times C$ where $A=\{0,1\},~B=\{1,2\},~and~C=\{0,1,2\}$

##### Solution:
$$A \times B \times C = \{(0,1,0),~(0,1,1),~(0,1,2),~(0,2,0),~(0,2,1),~(0,2,2),~(1,1,0),~(1,1,1),$$

$$~(1,1,2),~(1,2,0),~(1,2,1),~(1,2,2)\}$$
