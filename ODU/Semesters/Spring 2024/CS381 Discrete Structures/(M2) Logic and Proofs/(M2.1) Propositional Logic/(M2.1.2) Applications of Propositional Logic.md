## Applications of Propositional Logic

### Translating English Sentences

Build **expressions** involving *propositional variables* and *logical connectives* - *Why?*

1. To **remove ambiguity** from the sentences
2. To analyze the logical expressions and determine their truth values
3. To use **rules of inference** to reason about them

#### The Steps:

1. Identify atomic propositions and represent using propositional variables (name the variables).
2. Determine the appropriate logical connectives.

### Examples

#### Example 1

**Problem:** "If I go to Harry's or to the city, I will not go shopping."

**Solution:**

Step 1:

 * $p$ = I go to Harry's
 * $q$ = I go to the city
 * $r$ = I will go shopping

Step 2:

* If $p$ or $q$, then not $r$
* $(p \lor q)\to \neg r$

#### Example 2

**Problem:** "You can access the Internet from campus **only if** you are a computer science major or you are not a freshman."

**Solution:**

Step 1:

- $a$ = You can access the Internet from campus
- $c$ = You are a computer science major
- $f$ = You are a freshman

Step 2:

- $a$ only if $c$ or not $f$ translates to $a \to (c \lor \neg f)$

#### Example 3

**Problem:** "The automated reply cannot be sent when the file system is full."

**Solution:**

Step 1:

- $s$ = The automated reply can be sent
- $f$ = The file system is full

Step 2:

- not $s$ when $f$ translates to $f \to \neg s$
