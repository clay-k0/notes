## Intro to Propositional Logic

### Proposition / Claim

**Definition**: A ***proposition*** (claim) is a ***declarative*** sentence that is either ***true*** or ***false*** (but not both). They ***CANNOT*** be half true, half false, almost true, or almost false.

Thus, the person who makes the **proposition/claim** will be sharing <u>clear</u> and <u>precise</u> understanding with the audience of said **claim**.

**Examples**

The following <u>ARE</u> examples of **propositions**:
* The moon is made of green cheese.   (false)
* Richmond is the capitol of Virginia.     (true)
* 1 + 0 = 1                                                 (true)
* 0 + 0 = 2                                                (false)

The following are <u>NOT</u> examples of **propositions**:
* What time is it?                                     (question)
* Sit down and close the door, ...           (command/request for action)
* Wonderful!, Great!, Amazing!               (exclamation)
* x + 1 = 2                                                 (contains a variable; what is x?)
* This box is so heavy                             (subjectivity; what defines heavy?)

### Propositional Logic

**Constructing Propositions**

1. Propositional Variables: $p,q,r,s,\dots$ (small italic letters)
2. Examples:
	* $p$ = Today is my Birthday
	* $q$ = The sky is blue
	* $r$ = New York is the capitol of the US
3. A <u>true</u> proposition is denoted by <u>T</u> , while <u>false</u> propositions are denoted by <u>F</u>.
4. **Simple** vs **Compound** Propositions
	* <u>Simple</u> propositions includes a single propositional variable ($p$) 
	* <u>Compound</u> propositions are constructed from a **set** of propositions - *connected with **logical connectives***
		- **Example**: Today is my Birthday ($p$), ***and*** today is Monday ($q$)

### Logical Connectives

#### 1. Negation 

Negation $(\neg)$ can be represented by $\neg p$ and has a truth table like:

| $p$ | $\neg p$ |
| --- | -------- |
| T   | F        |
| F   | T        |

**Example**

If $p$ denotes "The Earth is round," then $\neg p$ denotes "It is **not** the case that the Earth is round," or "The Earth is **not** round"

#### 2. Conjunction ($\land$, and)

The **conjunction** of propositions $p$ and $q$ can be represented by $p\land q$ and has a truth table like:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \land q$ |
| --- | --- | ----------- |
| T   | T   | T           |
| T   | F   | F           |
| F   | T   | F           |
| F   | F   | F           |

**Example**

If $p$ denotes "I am at home" and $q$ denotes "It is raining," then $p \land q$ denotes "<u>I am at home</u> **and** <u>it is raining</u>"

#### 3. Disjunction ($\lor$, or)

The **disjunction** of propositions *p* and *q* can be represented by *p*âˆ¨*q* and has a truth table like:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \lor q$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- |
| T   | T   | T          |
| T   | F   | T          |
| F   | T   | T          |
| F   | F   | F          |

##### Example

If $p$ denotes "I am at home" and $q$ denotes "It is raining," then $p \lor q$ denotes "<u>I am at home</u> **or** <u>it is raining</u>"

> [!Note] 
> 
> This type of **or** is the ***inclusive*** **or** because **one true** proposition is sufficient for the statement to be **true**, and when **both** inputs are **true**, the output is **true**.

Or has two distinct meanings:

| Type                         | Example                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inclusive Or                 | "Students who have taken CS202 ***or*** MTH120 may enroll is  this class," either **one** or **both** of $p$ and $q$ must be **true**.                            |
| Exclusive Or $(XOR, \oplus)$ | "Dinner comes with soup **or** salad." We do not expect to get both soup and salad.<br><br>In $p \oplus q$, **one** of $p$ and $q$ must be true, but **not** both |

$XOR$ truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \oplus q$ |
| --- | --- | ------------ |
| T   | T   | _F_          |
| T   | F   | T            |
| F   | T   | T            |
| F   | F   | F            |


#### 4. Implication $(\to)$ 

Assume $p$ and $q$ are two propositions

$p \to q$ is a *conditional statement or **implication*** which is read as "if $p$, then $q$," and has a truth table like:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \to q$                             |
| --- | --- | ------------------------------------- |
| T   | T   | F                                     |
| T   | F   | _F_ (Always true except in this case) |
| F   | T   | T                                     |
| F   | F   | T                                     |
   
##### Implication Examples

1. If $p$ denotes "I am at home" and $q$ denotes "It is raining," then $p \to q$ denotes "**If** <u>I am at home</u>, **then** <u>it is raining</u>"

In $p \to q$,
- $p$ is the ***hypothesis*** (**antecedent/premise**) and
- $q$ is the ***conclusion*** (**consequence**)

Other examples include

2. **If** I win the election, **then** I will lower taxes.
3. **If** you eat your dinner, **then** you will play outside.
4. **If** you get all A's in your classes, **then** I will increase your allowance.

##### Different Ways of Expressing $p \to q$:

* if $p$, **then** $q$
* if $p,q$	
* $q$ **unless** $\neg p$
* $q$ **if** $p$
* $q$ **whenever** $p$
* $q$ **follows from** $p$
* $p$ **implies** $q$
* $p$ **only if** $q$
* $q$ **when** $p$
* $p$ **is sufficient for** $q$
* $q$ **is necessary for** $p$
* **a necessary condition for** $p$ **is** $q$
* **a sufficient condition for** $q$ **is** $p$

###### Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse

From $p \to q$ we can form new conditional statements, like:

1. $q \to p$ is the **converse** of $p \to q$
2. $\neg p\to \neg q$ is the **inverse** of $p \to q$
3. $\neg q \to \neg p$ is the **contrapositive** of $p \to q$

The **contrapositive** is equivalent to the **original implication**

For instance,

Find the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of "**It raining** is a sufficient condition for me **not going to town**."

$p$ = It is raining and $q$ = I am not going to town.

| Type               | Statement                                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Converse**       | If I am not going to town $(\neg q)$, then it is raining $(p)$.      |
| **Inverse**        | If it is not raining ($\neg p$), then I'm going to town $(\neg q)$.  |
| **Contrapositive** | If I am going to town $(\neg q)$, then it is not raining $(\neg p)$. |

###### Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse Truth Table

| $p$ | $q$ | $\neg p$ | $\neg q$ | $p \to q$ | $\neg p \to \neg q$ | $q \to p$ | $\neg q \to \neg p$ |
| --- | --- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ------------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| T   | T   | F        | F        | T         | T                   | T         | T                   |
| T   | F   | F        | T        | F         | T                   | T         | F                   |
| F   | T   | T        | F        | T         | F                   | F         | T                   |
| F   | F   | T        | T        | T         | T                   | T         | T                   |

#### 5. Bi-conditional $(\leftrightarrow)$

If $p$ and $q$ are propositions, then we can form the bi-conditional proposition$p \leftrightarrow q$, read as "*p* **if and only if** *q*"

$p \leftrightarrow q$ Truth Table:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \leftrightarrow q$ |
| --- | --- | --------------------- |
| T   | T   | _T_                   |
| T   | F   | F                     |
| F   | T   | F                     |
| F   | F   | _T_                   |

It is essentially the **opposite** of **XOR**. **ALL** inputs must be the **same** for the output to be **true** (even if all inputs are false).

##### Example

If $p$ denotes "I am at home" and $q$ denotes "It is raining", then $p \leftrightarrow q$ denotes "I am at home **if and only if** it is raining."

##### Different Ways of Expressing $p \leftrightarrow q$:

* $p$ **is necessary and sufficient for** $q$
* **if** $p$ **then** $q$, **and conversely**
* $p$ **iff** $q$

> [!Note]
> 
> $p \leftrightarrow q$ is the same as ($p \to q) \land (q \to p)$

### Precedence of Logical Operators in Compound Propositions

Assume the compound proposition $p \lor q \to \neg r$.

How can we calculate it?

Will it be calculated as:
* $(p \lor q) \to \neg r$ ?
or
* $p \lor (q \to \neg r)$ ?

Well, it depends on the precedence of the operators:

| Operator          | Precedence |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| $\neg$            | 1          |
| $\land$           | 2          |
| $\lor$            | 3          |
| $\to$             | 4          |
| $\leftrightarrow$ | 5          |

Thus, the given compound proposition will be calculated as $(p\lor q)\to \neg r$

However, if the intended meaning was for it to be interpreted as $p\lor(q\to \neg r)$ instead, then parenthesis must be used.
