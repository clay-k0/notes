## Translating from English to Logic

### Equivalences in Predicate Logic

Statements involving predicates and quantifiers are *logically equivalent* **if and only if** they have the same truth value
- For **every predicate substituted** into these statements and
- For **every domain of discourse** used for the variables in the expressions.

### Thinking About Quantifiers as Conjunctions and Disjunctions

If the domain is finite, a **universally** quantified proposition is equivalent to a **conjunction** of propositions.

If the domain is finite, an **existentially** quantified proposition is equivalent to a **disjunction** of propositions.

**Example:** If $U$ consists of the integers 1, 2, and 3.

Universal: $\forall x P(x) \equiv P(1) \land P(2) \land P(3)$

Existential: $\exists x P(x) \equiv P(1) \lor P(2) \lor P(3)$

### Negating Quantified Expressions

#### Example 1

Consider $\forall x J(x)$ 

"Every student in your class has taken a course in Java."

- $U$ = students in your class
- $J(x)$ = "x has taken a course in Java"

Negating the statement gives:

- "It is not the case that every student in your class has taken Java"
- Or simply, "There is a student in your class who has not taken Java"

Symbolically: $\lnot \forall x J(x)$ and $\exists x \lnot J(x)$ are equivalent

#### Example 2

Now consider $\exists x J(x)$
"There is a student in this class who has taken a course in Java"

- $U$ = students in your class
- $J(x)$  = "x has taken a course in Java"

Negating the statement gives:

- "It is not the case that there is a student in this class has taken Java"
- Or simply, "Every student in this class has not taken Java"

Symbolically $\lnot \exists x J(x)$ and $\forall  x \lnot J(x)$ are equivalent

### Translation from English to Logic

#### Example 1

"Some student in this class has visited Mexico."

1. Name the propositions

- $M(x)$ denotes "x has visited Mexico"
- $S(x)$ denotes "x is a student in this class"

2. Define the domain

- $U$ = all people

3. Convert to logic

- $\exists x (S(x) \land M(x))$

> [!Note]
> 
> We used $\land$ (conjunction) instead of $\to$ (implication) because we are dealing with an **existential** quantifier and not a **universal quantifier**. So, remember:
> 
> Existential: $\to$
> Universal: $\land$

#### Example 2

"Every student in this class has visited Canada or Mexico"

1. Name the propositions

- $C(x)$ = "x has visited Canada"
- $M(x)$ = "x has visited Mexico"
- $S(x)$ = "x is a student in this class"

2. Define the domain

- $U$ = All people

3. Convert to logic

- $\forall x (S(x) \to (C(x) \lor M(x))$

### System Specification Example

Predicate logic is used for specifying systems

**Example**, translate in to predicate logic:

- "Every mail message larger than one megabyte will be compressed"
- "If a user is active, at least one network link will be available"

The **domain** is left implicit here, so we only need to figure out the **predicates**

- Let $L(m,y)$ be "Mail message $m$ is **larger** than $y$ megabytes"
- Let $C(m)$ denote "Mail message $m$ will be **compressed**"

- Let $A(u)$ denote "User $u$ is **active**"
- Let $S(n,x)$ denote "Network link $n$ is in **state** x"

Thus, we have

$$\forall m(L(m, 1) \to C(m))$$

$$\exists u A(u) \to \exists n S(n,available)$$
