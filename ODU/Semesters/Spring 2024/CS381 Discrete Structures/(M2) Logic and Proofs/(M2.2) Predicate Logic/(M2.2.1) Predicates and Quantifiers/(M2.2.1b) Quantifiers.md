## Quantifiers

We need *quantifiers* to express the meaning of English words including **all** and **some**

**Examples:**
- "**All** men are mortal"
- "**Some** cats do not have fur"

| Two Most Important Quantifiers | Read As | Symbol |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Universal Quantifier | "For all," | $\forall$ |
| Existential Quantifier | "There exists (at least one)," | $\exists$ |

Hence, we can write things like $\forall x P(x)$ and $\exists x P(x)$
- $\forall x P(x)$ declares $P(x)$ is **true** for **every** x in the *domain*
- $\exists x P(x)$ declares $P(x) is **true** for **some** x in the *domain*

The quantifiers **bind** the variable **x** in these expressions. 
The variable is not a **free** variable anymore.

### Universal Quantifier

$\forall x P(x)$ is read as "For all x, $P(x)$" or "For every x, $P(x)$"

**Examples**:
- If $P(x)$ denotes "$x>0$" and $U$ is the **integers**, then $\forall x P(x)$ is **False**
	- Not every integer is greater than 0

- If $P(x)$ denotes "$x>0$" and $U$ is the **positive integers**, then $\forall x P(x)$ is **True**
	- Every positive integer is greater than 0

- If $P(x)$ denotes "x is even" and $U$ is the **integers**, then $\forall x P(x)$ is **False**
	- Not every integer is even

### Existential Quantifier

$\exists x P(x)$ can be read as
- "For some x, $P(x)$"
- "There is an x such that $P(x)$"
- "For at least one x, $P(x)$"


**Examples:**
- If $P(x)$ denotes "$x>0$" and $U$ is the **integers**, then $\exists x P(x)$ is **True**
	- At least one integer is greater than 0

- If $P(x)$ denotes "$x<0$" and $U$ is the **positive integers**, then $\exists x P(x)$ is **False**
	- Not a single positive integer is less than 0

- If $P(x)$ denotes "x is even" and $U$ is the **integers**, then $\exists x P(x)$ is **True**
	- At least one integer is even

### Properties of Quantifiers

The truth value of $\exists P(x)$ and $\forall x P(x)$ depend on both the propositional function $P(x)$ and the domain $U$

**Examples**:
- If $U$ is the **positive integers** and $P(x)$ is the statement "$x<2$", then $\exists x P(x)$ is **True**, but $\forall x P(x)$ is **false**.
	- There is at least one positive integer less than 2, but not all positive integers are less than 2

- If $U$ is the **negative integers** and $P(x)$ is the statement "$x<2$", then **both** $\exists x P(x)$ and $\forall x P(x)$ are **true**
	- There is at least one negative integer less than 2, and all negative integers are less than 2

- If $U$ consists of 3, 4, and 5, and $P(x)$ is the statement "$x<2$", then **both** $\exists x P(x)$ and $\forall x P(x)$ are **false**
	- Neither 3, 4, or 5 is less than 2, and not every value in 3, 4, and 5 is less than 2

### Precedence of Quantifiers

The quantifiers $\forall$ and $\exists$ have higher precedence than ALL logical operators

**Example:**
- The statement $\forall x P(x) \lor Q(x)$ means $(\forall x P(x)) \lor Q(x)$
	- The entire antecedent containing the quantifier gets priority
	- **NOTE**: $\forall x (P(x) \lor Q(x))$ means something different

**Unfortunately**, people often write $\forall x P(x) \lor Q(x)$ when they mean $\forall x (P(x) \lor Q(x))$

### Translating From English to Logic

**Example 1**: 

Translate the sentence to predicate logic:
"*Every student in this class has taken a course in Java.*"

**Solution 1:**
First, we need to find the domain, $U$. If $U$ is all students in this class, define a propositional function $J(x)$ denoting "*x has taken a course in Java*" and translate as $\forall x J(x)$.

**Solution 2**:
But if $U$ is all people, also define a propositional function $S(x)$ denoting "*x is a student in this class*" and translate as $\forall x(S(x)\to J(x))$.

**Example 2:** 

Translate the sentence to predicate logic:
"*Some student in this class has taken a course in Java.*"

**Solution 1**:
If $U$ is all students in this class, translate as $\exists x J(x)$ 

**Solution 2**:
But if $U$ is all people, then translate as $\exists x (S(x) \land J(x))$

**NOTE:** Notice that we used $\to$ (implication) for the **Universal Quantifier** example and $\land$ (conjunction) for the **Existential Quantifier** example.

### Returning to the Socrates Example

If we have
- "All men are mortal"
- "Socrates is a man"

Does it follow that "Socrates is mortal?"

We actually still can't answer it fully yet. We're getting closer. Let's use our newly learned propositional functions on it.

Introduce the propositional functions $Man(x)$ denoting "x is a man" and $Mortal(x)$ denoting "x is mortal." We can also specify the domain $U$ as **all people**.

There are **two** premises:
- $\forall Man(x) \to Mortal(x)$ - Remember, we said "ALL men are mortal"
- $Man(Socrates)$

The conclusion is $Mortal(Socrates)$

*Later, we will learn how exactly we prove the conclusion that we obtain from the premises.*
