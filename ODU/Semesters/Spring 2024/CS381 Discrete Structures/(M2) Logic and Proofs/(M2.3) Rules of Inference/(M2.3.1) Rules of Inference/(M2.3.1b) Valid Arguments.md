## Valid Arguments

### Using the Rules of Inference to Build Valid Arguments

**Valid Argument**: A sequence of statements, where is statement is either a premise or follows from previous statements by rules of inference. The last statement is called the conclusion.

A valid argument takes the following form:

$$
S_{1}
$$
$$
S_{2}
$$
$$
\vdots
$$
$$
S_{n}
$$
$$
----------
$$
$$
\therefore C
$$

### Valid Arguments

**Example:**

**Hypotheses:**
- "It is not sunny this afternoon and it is colder than yesterday."
- "We will go swimming only if it is sunny."
- "If we do not go swimming, then we will take a canoe trip."
- "If we take a canoe trip, then we will be home by sunset."

**Using Inference Rules, Construct A Valid Argument For The Conclusion :**

"We will be home by sunset."

**Solution:**

1. Choose the propositional variables

- $p$ = "It is sunny this afternoon."
- $q$ = "It is colder than yesterday."
- $r$ = "We will go swimming."
- $s$ = "We will take a canoe trip."
- $t$ = "We will be home by sunset."

2. Translate hypotheses into propositional logic

- $\lnot p \land q$
- $r \to p$
- $\lnot r \to s$
- $s \to t$

Conclusion: $t$

3. Construct the Valid Argument

| Step | Reason |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1. $\lnot p \land q$ | Premise |
| 2. $\lnot p$ | Simplification using 1 |
| 3. $r \to p$ | Premise |
| 4. $\lnot r$ | *Modus tollens* using 2 and 3 |
| 5. $\lnot r \to s$ | Premise |
| 6. $s$  | *Modus ponens* using 4 and 5 |
| 7. $s \to t$ | Premise |
| 8. $~\therefore t$ | *Modus ponens* using 6 and 7 |
