## Geometric Example
### Example:

For a certain manufacturing process, it is known that, on average, 1 in every 100 items is defective. What is the probability that the fifth item inspected is the first defective item found?

### Solution

$X$ is a geometric random variable

$p=\frac{1}{100}=0.01$ 

$q=1-0.01=0.99$

$x=5$ (inspecting the fifth item)

$$f(x)=pq^{x-1}=(0.01)(0.99)^{x-1}$$

$$f(5)=(0.01)(0.99)^{5-1}=(0.01)(0.99)^4=0.0096$$
