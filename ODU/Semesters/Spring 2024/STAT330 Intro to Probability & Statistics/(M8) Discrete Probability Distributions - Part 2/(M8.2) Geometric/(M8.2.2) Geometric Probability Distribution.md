## Geometric Probability Distribution

Let $X$ be the number of trials required to produce a single success. The probability distribution function (PDF) of $X$ is

$$f(x)=pq^{x-1},~x=1,2,3,\dots$$

where

$p=$ the per trial probability of success

$q$ = the per trial probability of failure = $1-p$

$X$ has a **geometric distribution**

### Proof of the Geometric Distribution

$P(x)=P(X=x)$
$=P$($x$ trials to get the $1^{st}$ success)
$= P$(exactly $x-1$ failures followed by a single success)
$=P(A)$

Notably, the last Bernoulli trial must be a success as the experiment concludes when we observe the $1^{st}$ success is observed. There, is only one outcome in event $A$.

There is exactly one way we can choose $x-1$ failures followed by a success in $x$ trials.

Thus,
$P(A)=$(# of outcomes in event $A$) $\times$ $P$(an outcome in event $A$)

### Mean and Variance of a Geometric Distribution

**Mean:**

$$\mu=\frac{1}{p}$$

**Variance:**

$$\sigma^2=\frac{q}{p^2}=\frac{1-p}{p^2}$$
