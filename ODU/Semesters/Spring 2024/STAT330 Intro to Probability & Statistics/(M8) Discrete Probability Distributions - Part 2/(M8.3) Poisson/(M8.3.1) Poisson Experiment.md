## Poisson Experiment

A Poisson random variable counts the number of outcomes occurring during a given time interval or a specific region. The given time interval can be of any length such as a minute, a day, a week, a month, or even an entire year. For example, the Poisson experiment can generate observations from the random variable $X$ representing the number of text messages received per hour by a CEO, the number of days school is closed due to snow during the winter, or the number of games postponed due to rain during a baseball season. The given specific region could be a line segment, an area, a volume, or maybe a piece of material. Using regions, $X$ could be the number of field mice per acre, the number of bacteria in a given culture, or the number of typing errors per page.
