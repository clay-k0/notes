## Null and Alternative Hypotheses

A manufacturer of car batteries claims that the life of the company's batteries is approximately normally distributed with a standard deviation equal to 0.9. A consumer advocacy group claims that the standard deviation is higher than 0.9. A random sample of 10 of these batteries has a standard deviation of 1.2 years, we want to test the consumer advocate's claim that $\sigma>0.9$.

The first step is to write hypotheses. For every hypothesis test, you will have two hypotheses.

Remember:

**Null Hypothesis:** $H_{0}$ equal to some value, innocent until proven guilty
**Alternative Hypothesis:** $H_{1}$ or $H_{a}$ differs from the null hypothesis, it's what we want to prove

If we are looking to see if the parameter _differs_ from the value in the null (greater or less), then we perform a _two-tailed test_:

$$H_{1}:\sigma^2\neq \mathrm{value}$$

If we are looking to ONLY see if the parameter is _greater than_ the value in the null, then we perform a _one-tailed test_ (_right-tailed_):

$$H_{1}:\sigma^2>\mathrm{value}$$

If we are looking to ONLY see if the parameter is _less than_ the value in the null, then we perform a _one-tailed test_ (_left-tailed_):

$$H_{1}:\sigma^2<\mathrm{value}$$

For our example of the car batteries, the null hypothesis would be that the variance is equal to the value claimed by the manufacturer, that is the accepted value:

$$H_{0}:\sigma^2=0.81$$

The mentioned consumer advocacy group claims that the standard deviation is higher than 0.9, so we have a one-tailed alternative:

$$H_{1}:\sigma^2>0.81$$

> The hypotheses are written in terms of variance, $\sigma^2$, and we used the relationship between variance and standard deviation to convert the standard deviation of 0.9 to the variance of $0.92^2=0.81$.


### Example

**Problem:** Past experience indicates that the time required for high school seniors to complete a standardized test is a normal random variable with a standard deviation of 6 minutes. A teacher claims that the standard deviation has decreased over time and is now less than 6 minutes. 

**Solution:** The null and alternative hypotheses would be:

$$H_{0}:\sigma^2=36$$
$$H_{1}:\sigma^2<36$$

The hypothesis test uses information from a sample to gather evidence to determine whether the null hypothesis holds true in the population. If there is enough evidence to disprove the null hypothesis, then we _reject_ the null. If not, then we _fail to reject_ the null.
