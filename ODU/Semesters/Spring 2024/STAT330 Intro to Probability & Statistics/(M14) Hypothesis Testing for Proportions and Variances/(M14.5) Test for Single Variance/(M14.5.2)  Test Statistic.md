## Test Statistic

Recall that a _test statistic_ is a value used in making a decision about whether or not to reject the null hypothesis. Using data from a sample, we can calculate a statistic, which is an estimate for the population parameter about which we are conducting the test. The test statistic is found by converting this sample statistic to a score, under the assumption the null hypothesis is true.

For testing a claim concerning a population variance, the sample variance is converted into a Chi-Squared random variable using the formula:

$$\chi^2=\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_{0}^2}$$

Remember, $s^2$ is calculated from the sample data, $\sigma_{0}^2$ is the value in the null hypothesis, and $n$ is the sample size. Our formula for sample variance, $s^2$, is:

$$s^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i}-\overline x)^2}{n-1}$$

### Example

**Problem:** A manufacturer of car batteries claims that the life of the company's batteries is approximately normally distributed with a standard deviation equal to 0.9. A consumer advocacy group claims that the standard deviation is higher than 0.9. A random sample of 10 of these batteries has a standard deviation of 1.2 years. Calculate the test statistic for testing the consumer advocate's claim.

**Solution:** 

The null and alternative hypotheses are:

$$H_{0}:\sigma^2=0.81$$
$$H_{1}:\sigma^2>0.81$$

The sample data gives us:

$n=10$

$s^2=1.2^2=1.44$

Therefore,

$$\chi^2=\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_{0}^2}=\frac{9(1.44)}{0.81}=16$$

Thus, our test statistic is $\chi^2=16$. We'll soon learn how to use this to evaluate whether our sample provides evidence to support or reject the null hypothesis.
