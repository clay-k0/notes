## Test Statistic

For testing a claim concerning the equality of two population variances, the sample variances are converted into a random variable with a $F$ Distribution using the formula:

$$f=\frac{s_{1}^2}{s_{2}^2}$$

where $s_{1}^2$ and $s_{2}^2$ are calculated from independent random samples of size $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$, respectively. Our formula for the sample variances are:

$$s_{1}^2-\frac{\sum_{i=1} ^{n_{{1}}}(x_{1i}-\overline x_{1})}{n_{1}-1}$$

$$s_{1}^2-\frac{\sum_{i=1} ^{n_{{2}}}(x_{2i}-\overline x_{2})}{n_{2}-1}$$

### Example

**Problem:** In testing for the difference in the tensile strength of two different types of thread, we assumed that the two unknown population variances were equal. Independent samples of 50 pieces of each type of thread were tested under similar conditions. Type A thread had an average tensile strength of 86.7 kilograms with a standard deviation of 6.28 kilograms, while type B thread had an average tensile strength of 77.8 kilograms with a standard deviation of 5.61 kilograms. Calculate the test statistic for testing the assumption of equal variances.

**Solution:**

The null and alternative hypotheses are:

$$H_{0}:\sigma_{1}^2=\sigma_{2}^2$$
$$H_{0}:\sigma_{1}^2\neq \sigma_{2}^2$$

Sample data gives us:

$$s_{1}^2=6.28^2=39.4384$$
$$s_{2}^2=5.61^2=31.4721$$

Therefore,

$$f=\frac{s_{1}^2}{s_{2}^2}=\frac{39.4384}{31.4721}=1.253$$

Our test statistic is $f=1.253$.

Let's learn ho to use this to evaluate whether our sample provides evidence to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
