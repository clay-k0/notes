## Traditional Method Example

### Steps to Conduct a Traditional Hypothesis Test

1. State the null and alternative hypothesis
2. Determine the fixed significance, $\alpha$, of the test
3. Choose and calculate the appropriate test statistic. Establish the critical region and critical value(s) based on $\alpha$
4. Make the statistical decision - if the test statistic falls in the critical region, _reject_ $H_{0}$; if the test statistic does not fall in the critical region, _fail to reject_ $H_{0}$.
5. State conclusions

### Example

**Problem:** A study is conducted to compare the lengths of time required by men and women to assemble a certain product. Past experience indicates that the distribution of times for both men and women is approximately normal but the variance of the times for women is less than that for men. A random sample of times for 11 men and 14 women had a sample standard deviation of 6.1 for men and a sample standard deviation of 5.3 for women. Test the claim that the variance for men is greater than the variance for women using a 0.05 level of significance and the Traditional Method.

**Solution:** 

1. **State the null and alternative hypothesis**

$$H_{0}:\sigma_{1}^2=\sigma_{2}^2$$
$$H_{0}:\sigma_{1}^2>\sigma_{2}^2$$

2. **Determine the fixed significance level, $\alpha$:**

$$\alpha=0.05$$

3. **Calculate the test statistic:**

$$s_{1}^2=6.1^2=37.21$$
$$s_{2}^2=5.3^2=28.09$$

Therefore,

$$f=\frac{s_{1}^2}{s_{2}^2}=\frac{37.21}{28.09}$$

**Find the critical region and critical value:**

$\nu_{1}=n_{1}-1=11-1=10$

$\nu_{2}=n_{2}-1=14-1=13$

Because this is a right-tailed test, $\alpha=0.05$ is the area in our right tail. In [Table A.6](./Resources/Table_A5.pdf), we can go to $\alpha=0.05,\nu_{1}=10,$ and $\nu_{2}=13$ to find the critical value $f=2.67$.

The critical region is any test statistic _greater_ than 2.67

4. **Make the statistical decision:**

Since the test statistic does _not_ fall within the critical region, we _fail to reject_ $H_{0}$.

5. **State Conclusions:**

There is _not_ sufficient evidence that at a 5% level of significance to support the claim that the variance for men is greater than the variance for women.
