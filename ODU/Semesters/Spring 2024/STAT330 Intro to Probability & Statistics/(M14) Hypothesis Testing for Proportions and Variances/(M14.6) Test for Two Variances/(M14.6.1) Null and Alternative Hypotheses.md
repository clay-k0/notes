## Null and Alternative Hypotheses

Now, let's consider the problems of testing the equality of two variances, $\sigma_{1}^2$ and $\sigma_{2}^2$, from two independent populations.

The first step is to write hypotheses. We know we will have two hypotheses:

**Null Hypothesis**

$$H_{0}:\sigma_{1}^2=\sigma_{2}^2$$

**Alternative Hypothesis**

Here, we have 3 possibilities

1. $H_{1}:\sigma_{1}^2 \neq \sigma_{2}^2$ (two-tailed test)
2. $H_{1}:\sigma_{1}^2<\sigma_{2}^2$ (left-tailed test)
3. $H_{1}:\sigma_{1}^2>\sigma_{2}^2$ (right-tailed test)

### Example

**Problem:** In testing for the difference in the tensile strength of two different types of thread, we assumed that the two unknown population variances were equal. What are the null and alternative hypotheses for testing this assumption?

**Solution:**

$$H_{0}:\sigma_{1}^2=\sigma_{2}^2$$
$$H_{1}:\sigma_{1}^2\neq \sigma_{2}^2$$

The hypothesis test uses information from two independent samples to gather evidence to determine whether the null hypothesis holds true in the populations. If there is enough evidence to disprove the null hypothesis, then we _reject_ the null. If not, then we _fail to reject_ the null.
