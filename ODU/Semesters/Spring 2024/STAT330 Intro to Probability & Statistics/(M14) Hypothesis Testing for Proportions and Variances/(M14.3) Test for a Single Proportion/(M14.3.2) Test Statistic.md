## Test Statistic

Recall, a _test statistic_ is a value used in making a decision about whether or not to reject the null hypothesis. Using data from a sample, we can calculate a statistic, which is an estimate for the population parameter about which we are conducting the test. The test statistic is found by converting this sample statistic to a score, under the assumption the null hypothesis is true.

Let's break it up into steps, and use the specific example of the population proportion. 

We learned that the sample proportion, $\hat{p}$, is the best point estimate for the population proportion $p$. The standard deviation for the sample proportion is $\sqrt{ \frac{pq}{n} }$. Therefore, we can calculate the test statistic as:

$$Z=\frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{ \frac{p_{0}q_{0}}{n} }}$$

Remember, $\hat{p}$ is calculated from the sample data, $p_{0}$ is the value in the null hypothesis, $q_{0}=1-p_{0}$, and $n$ is the sample size.

Notice that the standard deviation of $\hat{p}$, $\sqrt{ \frac{pq}{n} }$, in this formula is similar to the standard deviation of $\hat{p}$ in our formula for a confidence interval, the true value of $p$ and $q$ are unknown and estimated by $\hat{p}$ and $\hat{q}$. We calculate the test statistic under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true and we use these values for $p$ and $q$.

### Example

**Problem:** For our M&M example, we are testing the hypotheses:

$$H_{0}:p=0.24$$
$$H_{1}:p<0.24$$

Suppose that your sample bag of M&Ms contains 36 candies, 5 of which are blue. Calculate the test statistic.

**Solution:** 

$$\hat{p}=\frac{X}{n}=\frac{5}{36}=0.14$$

Our sample size is 36, and $p$ is the value from the null hypothesis of $0.24$. So, we calculate the test statistic as:

$$Z=\frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{ \frac{p_{0}q_{0}}{n} }}$$

$$Z=\frac{0.14-0.24}{\sqrt{ \frac{(0.24)(0.76)}{36} }}=-1.41$$

Therefore, our test statistic is $Z=-1.41$.
