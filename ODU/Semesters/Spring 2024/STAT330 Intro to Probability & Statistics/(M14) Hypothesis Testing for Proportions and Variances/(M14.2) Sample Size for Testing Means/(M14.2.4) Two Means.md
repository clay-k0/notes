## Two Means

Again, we are still considering how to calculate the the minimum sample size needed for a researcher who is planning a to conduct an experiment that results in a hypothesis test. The sample size is usually determined for a fixed ($\alpha$) and a fixed alternative. This time let's look at the cases where we are planning to conduct a hypothesis test for a claim concerning a difference between 2 population means when the population variances are known and sample sizes are equal.

#### Sample Size for a One-Sided Test of a Difference Between 2 Means

To calculate the minimum sample size when $n_{1}-n_{2}=n$ for testing a one-sided claim concerning a difference between 2 population means when the population variances are known:

$$n=\frac{(Z_{\alpha}+Z_{\beta})^2(\sigma_{1}^2+\sigma_{2}^2)}{\delta^2}$$

where

- $Z_{\alpha}$ is a $Z$-value with an area to the right equal to $\alpha$
- $Z_{\beta}$ is a $Z$-value with an area to the right equal to $\beta$
- $\sigma_{1}^2$ and $\sigma_{2}^2$ are the known population variances
- $\delta$ is the difference between $d_{0}$ and the fixed alternative

**Remember to round up**

#### Sample Size for a Two-sided Test of a Difference Between 2 Means

To calculate the minimum sample size when $n_{1}=n_{2}=n$ for testing a 2-sided claim concerning a difference between 2 population means when the population variances are known:

$$n=\frac{(Z_{\alpha}+Z_{\beta})^2(\sigma_{1}^2+\sigma_{2}^2)}{\delta^2}$$

where

- $Z_{\alpha}$ is a $Z$-value with an area to the right equal to $\alpha$
- $Z_{\beta}$ is a $Z$-value with an area to the right equal to $\beta$
- $\sigma_{1}^2$ and $\sigma_{2}^2$ are the known population variances
- $\delta$ is the difference between $d_{0}$ and the fixed alternative

**Remember to round up**

### Example

**Problem:** Suppose that we wish to test the hypothesis

$$H_{0}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=12$$
$$H_{1}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<12$$

for the tensile strength of two different types of threads, using an $\alpha=.01$ level of significance, when it is known that $\sigma_{1}^2=6$ and $\sigma_{2}^2=5.5$. Find the sample size required if the power of our test is to be $.95$ when the true difference the means is 10.

**Solution:**

This is a one-sided alternative, specifically a left-tailed test.

- $\alpha=.01$, and looking for the area to the left, $1-.01=.9900$, [Table A.3](./Resources/Table_A3.pdf) gives us $.9901$ so $Z_{\alpha}=2.33$
- Power = $1-\beta\to \beta=1-\mathrm{Power}=1-.95=.05$, and looking for the area to the left, $1-.05=.9500$, [Table A.3](./Resources/Table_A3.pdf) gives us $.9495$ and $.9505$, so $Z_{\beta}=1.645$
- $\sigma_{1}^2=6$ and $\sigma_{2}^2=5.5$
- $\delta=10-12=-2$

$$n=\frac{(Z_{\alpha}+Z_{\beta})^2(\sigma_{1}^2+\sigma_{2}^2)}{\delta^2}=\frac{(2.33+1.645)^2(6+5.5)}{(-2)^2}=45.4=46$$

Therefore, 46 observations are required from each type of thread if the test is to reject the null hypothesis 95% of the time when, in fact, the difference between the two mean tensile strengths is at most 10.
