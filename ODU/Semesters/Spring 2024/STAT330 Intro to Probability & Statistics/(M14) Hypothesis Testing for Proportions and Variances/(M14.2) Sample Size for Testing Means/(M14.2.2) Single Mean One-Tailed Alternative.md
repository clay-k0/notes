## Single Mean One-Tailed Alternative

When a researcher is going to conduct an experiment that results in a hypothesis test. The researcher should calculate the minimum sample size needed before collecting data. The sample size is usually determined for a fixed $\alpha$ and a fixed alternative. Let's look at the case where we are planning to conduct a hypothesis test for a one-sided claim concerning a population mean when the population variance is known.

### Sample Size for a One-Sided Test of a Single Mean

To calculate the minimum sample size for testing a one-sided claim concerning a single population mean when the population variance is known:

$$n=\frac{(Z_{\alpha}+Z_{\beta})\sigma^2}{\delta^2}$$

where 

- $Z_{\alpha}$ is a $Z$-value with an area to the right equal to $\alpha$
- $Z_{\beta}$ is a $Z$-value with an area to the right equal to $\beta$
- $\sigma^2$ is the known population variance
- $\delta$ is the difference between $\mu_{0}$ and the fixed alternative

Remember, the sample size _should always be a whole number_, therefore if your answer is not a whole number, you need to round your minimum sample size value up to the next largest whole number.

### Example

**Problem:** Suppose that we wish to test the hypothesis

$$H_{0}:\mu=68$$
$$H_{1}:\mu>68$$

for the weights of male students at a certain college, using an $\alpha=.05$ level of significance, when it known that $\sigma=5$. Find the sample size required if the power of our test is to be $.95$ when the true mean is 69 kilograms.

**Solution:**

- $\alpha=.05$, looking for an area to the left, $1-.05=.9500$. The closest values to $.9500$ on [Table A.3](./Resources/Table_A3.pdf) are $.9495$ and $.9505$, which are at $1.64$ and $1.65$, respectively, therefore $Z_{\alpha}=\frac{1.64+1.65}{2}=1.645$
- Power $=1-\beta$ where $\beta=1-\mathrm{Power}=1-.95=.05$. Therefore, $Z_{\beta}=1.645$
- $\sigma^2=5^2=25$
- $\delta=69-68=1$ (This is the difference between $\mu_{0}=68$ and the fixed alternative of 69 in the problem statement)

$$n=\frac{(Z_{\alpha}+Z_{\beta})\sigma^2}{\delta^2}=\frac{(1.645+1.645)^2(25)}{1^2}=270.6$$

Therefore, 271 observations are required if the test is to reject the null hypothesis 95% of the time when, in fact, $\mu$ is as large as 69 kilograms.
