## Single Mean Two-Tailed Alternative

Remember, we are considering how to calculate the the minimum sample size needed for a researcher who is planning a to conduct an experiment that results in a hypothesis test. The sample size is usually determined for a fixedÂ $\alpha$ and a fixed alternative. This time, let's look at the case where we are planning to conduct a hypothesis test for a two-sided claim concerning a population mean when the population variance is known.

### Sample Size for a Two-Sided Test of a Single Mean

To calculate the minimum sample size for testing a two-sided claim concerning a single population mean when the population variance is known:

$$n-\frac{\left( Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}+Z_{\beta} \right)\sigma^2}{\delta^2}$$

where

- $Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is a $Z$-value with an area to the right equal to $\frac{\alpha}{2}$
- $Z_{\beta}$ is a $Z$-value with an area to the right equal to $\beta$
- $\sigma^2$ is the known population variance
- $\delta$ is the difference between $\mu_{0}$ and the fixed alternative

Remember to round up.

### Example

**Problem:** Suppose that we wish to test the hypothesis

$$H_{0}:\mu=68$$
$$H_{1}:\mu \neq 68$$

for the weights of male students at a certain college, using an $\alpha=.05$ level of significance, when it is known that $\sigma=5$. Find the sample size required if the power of our test is to be $.95$ when the true mean is 69 kilograms.

**Solution:**

- $\frac{\alpha}{2}=\frac{.05}{2}=.025$, looking for the area to the left, $1-.025=.975$ inside the body of [Table A.3](./Resources/Table_A3.pdf) leads us to an exact match at $Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}=1.96$
- Power = $1-\beta\to \beta=1-\mathrm{Power}=1-.95=.05$, looking for the area to the left, $1-.05=.9500$, which leads us to $.9495$ and $.9505$ in [Table A.3](./Resources/Table_A3.pdf). Therefore, $Z_{\beta}=1.645$
- $\sigma^2=5^2=25$
- $\delta=69-68=1$

$$n=\frac{\left( Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}+Z_{\beta} \right)\sigma^2}{\delta^2}=\frac{(1.96+1.645)^2(25)}{1^2}=324.9$$

Therefore, 325 observations are required if the test is to reject the null hypothesis 95% of the time when, in fact, $\mu$ is as large as 69 kilograms. Our sample size increased from our previous example by changing the alternative hypothesis from right-tailed to 2-tailed.
