### Example
A teacher gives a 20 question true/false exam. Let $X$ be the number of correct answers.

**a)** Find the exact value of getting 12 correct answers.
**b)** Use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution to find the probability of getting 12 correct answers.

### Solution
**a)** $X$ is a binomial random variable with $n=20$ and $p=0.5$
$$f(x)={20 \choose 12}0.5^{12}0.5^8=0.1201$$


**b)**
$$\mu=np=20(0.5)=10$$
$$\sigma^2=npq=20(0.5)(0.5)=5$$
$$\sigma=\sqrt{ 5 }$$

The problem wants the probability of getting exactly 12 correct answers where $X$ is a discrete random variable. If we think about estimating this probability with continuous random variables, any value between $11.5< X<12.5$ would round to 12 correct answers. This is called **applying the continuity correction.**

$P(X=12)$                           Binomial Problem
$=P(11.5<X<12.5)$      Normal Approx. with the Continuity Correction

Recall the formula $z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$

$$z=\frac{11.5-10}{\sqrt{ 5 }}=0.67~~~~~~~z=\frac{12.5-10}{\sqrt{ 5 }}=1.12$$
$$=P(0.67<Z<1.12)=0.8686-0.7476=0.1210$$

Comparing parts a) and b), the normal distribution is a pretty reasonable approximation of the binomial distributions
