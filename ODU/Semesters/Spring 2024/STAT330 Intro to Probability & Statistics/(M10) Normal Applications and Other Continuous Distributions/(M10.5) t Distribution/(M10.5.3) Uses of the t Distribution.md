## Uses of the $t$ Distribution

**Theorem:** Let $Z$ be a standard normal distribution and $V$ be chi-squared distribution with $\nu$ degrees of freedom. Assume $Z$ and $V$ are independent. Then, $$T=\frac{Z}{\sqrt{ \frac{V}{\nu} }}$$
has a $t$ distribution with $\nu$ degrees of freedom.

Let $\overline x$ and $s^2$ denote the mean and variance of a random sample of size $n$ from a normal population with mean = $\mu$ and standard deviation = $\sigma$. Then,
1. $Z=\frac{\overline x - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}}$ has a standard normal distribution from the central limit theorem
2. $V=\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2}$ has a chi-square distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom
3. $Z$ and $V$ are independent random variables

Then, $$T=\frac{\overline x - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$
has a $t$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
