**Definition:** A random variable has a $t$ distribution with $\nu$ degrees of freedom if the PDF is $$f(x)=\begin{cases}
\frac{c}{(1+\frac{x^2}{\nu})^{(\nu+1)/2}}, & -\infty<x<\infty \\
0, &otherwise
\end{cases}$$
where $c$ is a positive constant and $\nu=1,2,3,\dots$

We will denote a random variable with a $t$ distribution as $T$.

The PDF of a $t$ distribution is symmetric with mean = 0 and is similar in shape to the standard normal distribution except it has heaver tails.

The variance for the standard normal distribution is $\sigma^2=1$, while the variance for a $t$ distribution is greater than 1. Specifically, $$E(T)=0$$ <p style="text-align: center;">and</p> $$Var(T)=\frac{\nu}{\nu-2}$$
if $\nu>2$

As $\nu\to \infty$, the $t$ distribution converges to the standard normal distribution.

The $t$ distribution is tabled in the appendix of our textbook as Table A.4. The table gives only positive limits $t_{\alpha}$ such that $P(T\geq t_{\alpha})=\alpha$ for $df=1,2,\dots,30,40,60,120,\infty$.
