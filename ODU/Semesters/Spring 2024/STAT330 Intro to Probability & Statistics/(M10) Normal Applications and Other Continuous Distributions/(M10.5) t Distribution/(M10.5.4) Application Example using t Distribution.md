### Practical Example
**Problem:** A chemical engineer claims that the population mean yield of a certain batch process is 500 grams per milliliter of raw material. To check this claim he samples 25 batches each month. If the computed $t$-value falls between $-t_{0.05}$ and $t_{0.05}$, he is satisfied with his claim. What conclusion should he draw from a sample that has a mean of 518 grams per milliliter and a sample standard deviation of 40 grams? Assume the distribution of yields to be approximately normal.

**Solution:**
From [Table A.4](ODU/Semesters/Spring%202024/STAT330%20Intro%20to%20Probability%20&%20Statistics/(M10)%20Normal%20Applications%20and%20Other%20Continuous%20Distributions/(M10.5)%20t%20Distribution/Resources/Table%20A4%20-%20Critical%20Values%20of%20the%20t%20Distribution.pdf) we find that $t_{0.05}=1.711$ for 24 degrees of freedom. Therefore, the engineer can be satisfied with his claim if a sample of 25 batches yields a $t$-value between $-1.711$ and $1.711$. If $\mu=500$, then $$t=\frac{518-500}{\frac{40}{\sqrt{ 25 }}}=2.25$$
This is a value well above $1.711$. The probability of obtaining a $t$-value with $\nu=24$, equal to or greater than $2.25$ is approximately $0.02$. If $\mu>500$, the value of $t$ computed from the sample is more reasonable. Hence, the engineer is likely to conclude that the process produces a better product than he thought.
