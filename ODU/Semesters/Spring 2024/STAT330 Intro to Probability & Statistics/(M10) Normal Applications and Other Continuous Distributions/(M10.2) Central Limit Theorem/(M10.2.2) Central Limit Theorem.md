## Central Limit Theorem

**Central Limit Theorem:** If $\overline x$ is the mean of a random sample of size $n$ taken from a population with mean $\mu$ and a finite variance $\sigma^2$, then as $n \to \infty$

$$z=\frac{\overline x - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$ 

has a **standard normal distribution.**

The sample mean, $\overline x$, has approximately a normal distribution if $n$ is large, so how large must $n$ be?
- If the population is normally distributed, then $\overline x$ has a normal distribution of $n=1,2,3,\dots$
- If the population probability distribution function (PDF) has a rectangular shape (uniform distribution), then $\overline x$ is approximately for $n\geq 15$.
- The normal approximation is usually good if $n \geq 30$.
- The only exception is when the population is highly skewed for which the sample size would need to be even larger for the distribution of sample means to be approximately bell-shaped.
