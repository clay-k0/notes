## Confidence Interval Method

Conducting a hypothesis test using a confidence interval is very similar to problems we have already completed in earlier modules.

### Steps to Conduct a Confidence Interval Method Hypothesis Test

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses
2. Choose and calculate an appropriate confidence interval
3. Make a statistical decision by comparing the computed confidence interval to the hypotheses
4. State conclusions

### Recap Making the Decision using the Confidence Interval Method

If a confidence interval for a population parameter does not contain the value in the null hypothesis, then we reject the null hypothesis. The confidence interval contains the most likely values of the parameter, so if the value in the null hypothesis is not contained, then it is unlikely.

If the confidence interval contains the value of the population parameter in the null hypothesis, then we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
