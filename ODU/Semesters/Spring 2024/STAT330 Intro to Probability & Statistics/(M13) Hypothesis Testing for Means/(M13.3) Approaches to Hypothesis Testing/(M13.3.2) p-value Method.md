## $p$-value Method

Conducting a hypothesis test using a $p$-value is very similar to using the Traditional Method. The major difference is that instead of using critical values and critical regions, we use a $p$-value to make the statistical decision.

### Steps to Conduct a $p$-value Method Hypothesis Test

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses
2. Choose and calculate an appropriate test statistic
3. Calculate a test statistic
4. Compute the $p$-value based on the value of the test statistic and appropriate sampling distribution
5. Make a statistical decision by comparing the $p$-value to the significance level of the test
6. State conclusions

### Recap Making the Decision using $p$-value Method

- Uses the significance level $\alpha$

If $p$-value $< \alpha$, reject $H_{0}$
- This means that the probability of getting a test statistic equal to the one we got, or even farther away from the center of the curve is very small, where "small" is defined by the significance level; therefore, by the rare event rule, we determine that the null is false, and reject it.

If $p$-value $>\alpha$, fail to reject $H_{0}$
- This means that the probability of getting a test statistic equal to the one we got, or even farther away from the center of the curve is not small enough to be considered rare when compared to the significance level; therefore, we don't have enough evidence to determine that the null is false.
