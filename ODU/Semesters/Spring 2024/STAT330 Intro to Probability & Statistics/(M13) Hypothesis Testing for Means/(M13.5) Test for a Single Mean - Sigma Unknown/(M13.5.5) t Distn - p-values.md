## $t$ Distn: $p$-values

We have defined a $p$-value as the probability of getting a value of the test statistic is _at least as extreme_ as the one representing the sample data, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis is rejected if the $p$-value is very small, specifically if the $p$-value is less than or equal to $\alpha$ the decision is to _reject_ $H_{0}$.

Since exact $p$-values are often not obtainable from standard tables like [Table A.4](./Resources/Table_A4.pdf), we usually determine a range of $p$-values. The specific method for calculating a $p$-value varies based on the type of alternative hypothesis:

- If the alternative is _greater than_, $p$ = area to the _right_ of the test statistic
- If the alternative is _less than_, $p$ = area to the _left_ of the test statistic
- If the alternative is _not equal to_, $p$ = area to the _two times_ the area in the tail beyond the test statistic

### Examples

#### Example 1: One-Sided Test ($>$)

**Problem:** Test if $\mu > 100$ with a sample size of $n = 8$ and a test statistic of $t = 1.92$.

**Solution:**

- Degrees of freedom ($\nu$): $n - 1 = 8-1=7$
- Using Table A.4, find the range for $t = 1.9200$: Between $t = 1.895$ and $t = 2.365$.
- Corresponding $p$-value range: $.025 < p < .05$.
- **Decision**:
    - If $\alpha = .05$, reject $H_0$.
    - If $\alpha = .01$, fail to reject $H_0$.

Therefore,

$$.025<p<.05$$

> [!Note]
> 
> If $\alpha=.05$, we would _reject_ $H_{0}$, but if $\alpha=.01$, we would _fail to reject_ $H_{0}$. If $\alpha=.02$, we would not be able to make a decision using [Table A.4](./Resources/Table_A4.pdf) 


#### Example 2: One-Sided Test ($<$)

**Problem:** Test if $\mu < 55$ with a sample size of $n = 12$ and a test statistic of $t = -2.99$.

**Solution:**

- Degrees of freedom ($\nu$): $n - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11$
- The area corresponding to $|-2.99|$ is between $.0075$ and $.005$.
- **Decision**:
    - If $\alpha = .01$, reject $H_0$.
    - If $\alpha = .005$, fail to reject $H_0$.

Therefore,

$$.005<p<.0075$$

#### Example 3: Two-Sided Test

**Problem:** Test if $\mu \neq 100$ with a sample size of $n = 6$ and a test statistic of $t = 3.01$.

**Solution:**

- Degrees of freedom $\nu=n-1=6-1=5$
- Find $p$-value for the tail beyond $t = 3.01$: Between $.015$ and $.01$.
- Double these values for a two-sided test: $.02 < p < .03$.
- **Decision**:
    - If $\alpha = .05$, reject $H_0$.
    - If $\alpha = .01$, fail to reject $H_0$.

Therefore, 

$$.02<p<.03$$
