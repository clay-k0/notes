## Test Statistic: Sigma Unknown

If the population standard deviation, $\sigma$, then it must be estimated by the sample standard deviation, $s$, and the test statistic is calculated by:

$$t=\frac{\overline x - \mu_{0}}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$

This test statistic has a $t$ Distribution with $\nu=n-1$ degrees of freedom. Critical values an $p$-values will be calculated using [Table A.4](./Resources/Table_A4.pdf).

### Example

Remember, $\overline x$ is calculated or identified from the sample data, $\mu$ is the value in the null hypothesis, $s$ is the sample standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size;

For this example, we are testing the hypotheses:

$$H_{0}:\mu=16.3$$
$$H_{1}:\mu \neq 16.3$$

Sample data gives us

$$n=10$$

$$\overline x = 17.1$$

$$s=1.8$$

Note that the _sample standard deviation was given_ instead of the _population standard deviation_. This is important since our test statistic is now a $t$ instead of a $Z$. We calculate the test statistic as:

$$t=\frac{\overline x-\mu_{0}}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$

$$t=\frac{17.1-16.3}{\frac{1.8}{\sqrt{ 10 }}}=2.46$$

Our test statistic is $t=2.46$
