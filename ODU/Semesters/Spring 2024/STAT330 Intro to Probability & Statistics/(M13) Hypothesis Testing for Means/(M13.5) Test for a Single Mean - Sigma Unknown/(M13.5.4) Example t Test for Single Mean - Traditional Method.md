## $t$ Test for Single Mean: Traditional Method

**Problem:** An educator claims that the average salary of substitute teachers in school districts in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, is less than $60 per day. A random sample of eight school districts is selected, and the average daily salary is found to be 58.9 with a standard deviation of 5.1 Is there enough evidence to support the educator's claim at $\alpha=.10$>

**Solution:**

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses:

$$H_{0}:\mu=60$$

$$H_{1}:\mu<60$$

2. Determine the fixed significance level, $\alpha$:

$$\alpha=.10$$

3. Calculate the test statistic:

Since the population standard deviation is _not known_, this is a $t$ test.

$$t=\frac{\overline x - \mu_{0}}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$

$$t=\frac{58.9-60}{\frac{5.1}{\sqrt{ 8 }}}=-0.61$$

Find the critical region and critical value:

This is a _left-tailed_ test since the alternative is _less than_. Find the critical values using [Table A.4](./Resources/Table_A4.pdf) as follows:
- Use the _row_ corresponding to degrees of freedom $\nu-n-1=8-1=7$
- Use the _column_ corresponding to $\alpha=.10$
- A left-tailed test has one negative critical value, therefore the critical $t$ value is $-1.415$

4. Make the statistical decision:

Since the test statistic does _not_ fall within the critical region, we fail to reject $H_{0}$.

5. State Conclusions:

There _is not_ sufficient sample evidence to support the claim that the average salary of substitute teachers in Allegheny County is less than $60 per day
