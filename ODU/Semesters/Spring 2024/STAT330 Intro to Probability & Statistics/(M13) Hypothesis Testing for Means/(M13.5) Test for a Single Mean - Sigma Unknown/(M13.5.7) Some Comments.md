## Some Important Comments

### Choosing Between Z Test and t Test

**Key Decision Factor:** Whether the population standard deviation is known.

#### Z Test

- **Use Case:** The population standard deviation ($\sigma$) is known.
- **Distribution:** Standard Normal Distribution ($Z$ Distribution).
- **Application:** Use this test to compute critical values or $p$-values when the exact value of $sigma$ is provided.
- **Indicators in Problem Statement:** Look for explicit mentions of "population standard deviation" or the symbol $sigma$.

#### t Test

- **Use Case:** The population standard deviation is not known.
- **Distribution:** t Distribution.
- **Degrees of Freedom:** Depends on the sample size (usually $n-1$, where $n$ is the sample size).
- **Application:** Preferable when $\sigma$ is unknown; uses the sample standard deviation as an estimate.
- **Practice Note:** While some sources may permit using the $Z$ distribution if $n$ is large, the $t$ distribution is generally more accurate, especially when statistical software is available.

### Summary

- **Z Test:** Known σ, use Standard Normal Distribution.
- **t Test:** Unknown σ, use t Distribution with appropriate degrees of freedom.
