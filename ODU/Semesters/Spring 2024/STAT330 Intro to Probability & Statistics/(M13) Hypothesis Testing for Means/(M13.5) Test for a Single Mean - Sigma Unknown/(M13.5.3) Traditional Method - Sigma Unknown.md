## Traditional Method: Sigma Unknown

### Steps to Conduct a Traditional Hypothesis Test
1. State the null and alternative hypotheses
2. Determine the fixed significance level, $\alpha$, of the test (as a student, this will typically be given to you - as a researcher you would set $\alpha$ based on how much error you are willing to accept)
3. Choose and calculate the appropriate test statistic. Establish the critical region and critical value(s) based on $\alpha$.
4. Make the statistical decision - if the test statistical falls in the critical region, _reject_ $H_{0}$; if the test statistic does not fall in the critical region, _fail to reject_ $H_{0}$.
5. State conclusions

#### Examples

**Problem:** A medical investigation claims that the average number of infections per week at a hospital in southwestern Pennsylvania is 16.3 A random sample of 10 weeks had a mean number of 17.7 infections. The sample standard deviation is 1.8. Is there enough evidence to reject the investigator's claim at $\alpha=.05$?

**Solution:**

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses:

$$H_{0}:\mu=16.3$$

$$H_{1}:\mu \neq 16.3$$

2. Determine the fixed significance level, $\alpha$:

$$\alpha=.05$$

3. Calculate the test statistic:

Since the population standard deviation is not known, this is a $t$ test.

$$t=\frac{\overline x - \mu_{0}}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$

$$t=\frac{217.7-16.3}{\frac{1.8}{\sqrt{ 10 }}}=2.46$$

Find the critical region and critical value:

This is a two-tailed test since the alternative is _not equals_. Find the critical values using [Table A.4](./Resources/Table_A4.pdf) as follows:

1. Use the _row_ corresponding to degrees of freedom $\nu=n-1=10-1=9$

2. Use the _column_ corresponding to $\frac{\alpha}{2}=\frac{.05}{2}=.025$
	- We divided $\alpha$ by 2 because this is a two-tailed test

3. A two-tailed test has two critical values, one positive and one negative. At $\nu=9$ and $\alpha=.025$, we find the critical $t$ values are $-2.262$ and $+2.262$.

4. Make the statistical decision:

Since the test statistic falls _within_ the critical region, we _reject_ $H_{0}$

5. State conclusions

There is _sufficient_ evidence to _warrant rejection_ of the claim the average number of infections is 16.3
