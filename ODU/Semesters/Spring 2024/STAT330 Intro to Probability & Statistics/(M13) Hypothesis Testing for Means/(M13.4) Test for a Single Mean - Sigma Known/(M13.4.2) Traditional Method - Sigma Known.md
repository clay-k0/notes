## Traditional Method: Sigma Known

### Steps to Conduct a Traditional Method Hypothesis Test

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Determine the fixed significance level, $\alpha$, of the test (as a student, this will typically be given, whereas researchers must set $\alpha$ based on how much error they are willing to accept).
3. Choose and calculate the appropriate test statistic. Establish the critical region and critical value(s) based on $\alpha$.
4. Make the statistical decision - if the test statistic falls in the critical region, _reject $H_{0}$_; if the test statistic does not fall in the critical region, _fail to reject $H_{0}$_.
5. State conclusions

### Example

**Problem:** A researcher reports that the average salary of assistant professors is more than $42,000. A sample of 30 assistant professors has a mean salary of $43,260. At $\alpha=0.05$, test the claim that assistant professors earn more than $42,000 per year. The standard deviation of the population is $5,230.

**Solution:**

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses:

$$H_{0}:\mu=42,000$$

$$H_{1}:\mu>42,000$$

2. Determine the fixed significant level, $\alpha$:

$$\alpha=.05$$

3. Calculate the test statistic

$$Z=\frac{\overline x - \mu_{0}}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$

$$Z=\frac{43260-42000}{\frac{5230}{\sqrt{ 30 }}}=1.32$$
