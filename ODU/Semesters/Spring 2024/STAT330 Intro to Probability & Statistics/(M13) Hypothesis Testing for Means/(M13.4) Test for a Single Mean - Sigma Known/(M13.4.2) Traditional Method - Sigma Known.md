## Traditional Method: Sigma Known

### Steps to Conduct a Traditional Method Hypothesis Test

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Determine the fixed significance level, $\alpha$, of the test (as a student, this will typically be given, whereas researchers must set $\alpha$ based on how much error they are willing to accept).
3. Choose and calculate the appropriate test statistic. Establish the critical region and critical value(s) based on $\alpha$.
4. Make the statistical decision - if the test statistic falls in the critical region, _reject_ $H_{0}$; if the test statistic does not fall in the critical region, _fail to reject_ $H_{0}$.
5. State conclusions

### Example

**Problem:** A researcher reports that the average salary of assistant professors is more than \$42,000. A sample of 30 assistant professors has a mean salary of \$43,260. At $\alpha=0.05$, test the claim that assistant professors earn more than \$42,000 per year. The standard deviation of the population is \$5,230.

**Solution:**

1. State the Null and Alternative Hypotheses:

$$H_{0}:\mu=42,000$$

$$H_{1}:\mu>42,000$$

2. Determine the Significance Level, $\alpha$:

$$\alpha=.05$$

3. Calculate the Test Statistic:

Since the population standard deviation is known, this is $Z$ test.

$$Z=\frac{\overline x - \mu_{0}}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$

$$Z=\frac{43260-42000}{\frac{5230}{\sqrt{ 30 }}}=1.32$$

Find the critical region and critical value:

This is a right-tailed test since the alternative is greater than. So, the critical value will cutoff an area of $\alpha=.05$ in the right tail. To use [Table A.3](ODU/Semesters/Spring%202024/STAT330%20Intro%20to%20Probability%20&%20Statistics/(M13)%20Hypothesis%20Testing%20for%20Means/(M13.4)%20Test%20for%20a%20Single%20Mean%20-%20Sigma%20Known/Resources/Table_A3.pdf), we find the area to left of the critical value to be $1-\alpha=1-.05=.9500$. 

When looking for the closest value to $0.9500$ in the table, you find $0.9495$ and $0.9505$. Since both values are equidistant from $0.9500$,

$$Z=\frac{1.64+1.65}{2}=1.645$$

Thus, the table shows that $Z=1.645$ cuts off an area of $.05$ in the right tail of the curve. So, our critical value is $1.645$. 

As the picture below shows, the critical region includes any values of the test statistic greater than $1.645$.

Our test statistic $1.32$ does _not_ fall in the critical (_rejection_) region.

4. Make the Statistical Decision:

Since the test statistic does not fall within the critical region, we would _fail to reject_ $H_{0}$.

5. State Conclusions:

There is not enough evidence to support the claim that assistant professors earn more on average than \$42,000 per year.
