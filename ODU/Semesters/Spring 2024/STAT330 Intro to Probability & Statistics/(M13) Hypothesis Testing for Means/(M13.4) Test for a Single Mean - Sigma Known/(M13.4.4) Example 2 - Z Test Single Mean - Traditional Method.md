## Z-Test Single Mean: Traditional Method

#### Example 2

**Problem:** The Medical Rehabilitation Education Foundation reports that the average cost of rehabilitation for stroke victims is \$24,672. To see if the average cost of rehabilitation is different at a particular hospital, a researcher selects a random sample of 35 stroke victims at the hospital and finds that the average cost of their rehabilitation is \$25,226. The standard deviation of the population is \$3251. At $\alpha=.01$, can it be concluded that the average cost of stroke rehabilitation at a particular hospital is different from \$24,672.

**Solution:**

1. State the Null and Alternative Hypotheses

$$H_{0}:\mu=24,672$$

$$H_{1}:\mu \neq 24,672$$

2. Determine the Significance Level, $\alpha$:

$$\alpha=.01$$

3. Calculate the Test Statistic:

Since the population standard deviation, $\sigma$, is known, this is a $Z$ test.

$$Z=\frac{\overline x - \mu_{0}}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$

$$Z=\frac{25226-24672}{\frac{3251}{\sqrt{ 35 }}}=1.01$$

Find the critical regions and critical values:

This is a two-tailed test since the alternative is not equals. So, the critical values will cutoff an area of $\frac{\alpha}{2}=\frac{.01}{2}=.005$ in both the left tail and right tail of the distribution.

When looking inside [Table A.3](ODU/Semesters/Spring%202024/STAT330%20Intro%20to%20Probability%20&%20Statistics/(M13)%20Hypothesis%20Testing%20for%20Means/(M13.4)%20Test%20for%20a%20Single%20Mean%20-%20Sigma%20Known/Resources/Table_A3.pdf) for the closest value to $0.0050$, you find $0.0051$ and $0.0049$. Since both values are equidistant from 0.0050,

$$Z=\frac{-2.57+(-2.58)}{2}=-2.575$$

Therefore, by the property of symmetry, our critical values are $-2.575$ and $2.575$.

As the picture below shows, the critical region includes any values of the test statistic less than $-2.575$ or greater than $2.575$

Our test statistic of $1.01$ falls does _not_ fall in the critical (_rejection_) region.

4. Make a Statistical Decision:

Since the test statistic does not fall within the critical region, we _fail to reject_ $H_{0}$.

5. State Conclusions:

There is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that the average cost of rehabilitation at the particular hospital is different from $24,672.
