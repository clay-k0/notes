## Z Test Single Mean: $p$-value Method

### Example 2

**Problem:** A random sample of 100 recorded deaths in the United States during the past year showed an average life span of 71.8 years. Assuming a population standard deviation of 8.9 years, does this seem to indicate the mean life span today is less than 72 years? Use the $p$-value method where $\alpha=.05$.

**Solution:** 

1. State the Null and Alternative Hypotheses:

$$H_{0}:\mu=72$$

$$H_{1}:\mu<72$$

2. Choose and Calculate the Appropriate Test Statistic:

$$Z=\frac{\overline x - \mu_{0}}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$

$$Z=\frac{71.8-72}{\frac{8.9}{\sqrt{ 100 }}}=-0.22$$

3. Compute the $p$-value:

We will use the Standard Normal Distribution to calculate the $p$-value because the population standard deviation is known.

This is a left-tailed test since the alternative is less than. Since our test is a left-tailed test, the $p$-value is equal to the area to the left of the test statistic using the Standard Normal Distribution.

Looking at [Table A.3](./Resources/Table_A3.pdf), we find the area to the left of $-0.22$ to be $.4129$. Therefore,

$$p=.4129$$

4. Make a Statistical Decision

Since the $p$-value of $.4129$ is greater than the significance level of $.05$, we _fail to reject_ $H_{0}$.

5. State Conclusions

There is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that the mean life span today is less than 72 years.
