## Z-Test Single Mean: Traditional Method

#### Example 1

**Problem:** A researcher claims that the average cost of men's athletic shoes is less than \$80. He selects a random sample of 36 pairs of shoes from a catalog and finds the sample mean to be \$75. Is there enough evidence to support the researcher's claim at $\alpha=.10$? Assume $\sigma=19.2$.

**Solution:**

1. State the Null and Alternative Hypotheses

$$H_{0}:\mu=80$$

$$H_{1}:\mu<80$$

2. Determine the Significance Level, $\alpha$:

$$\alpha=.10$$

3. Calculate the Test Statistic:

Since the population standard deviation, $\sigma$, is known, this is a $Z$ test.

$$Z=\frac{\overline x - \mu_{0}}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$

$$Z=\frac{475-80}{\frac{19.2}{\sqrt{ 36 }}}=-1.56$$

Find the critical region and critical value:

This is a left-tailed test since the alternative is less than. So, the critical value will cutoff an area of $\alpha=.10$ in the left tail. 

When looking inside [Table A.3](ODU/Semesters/Spring%202024/STAT330%20Intro%20to%20Probability%20&%20Statistics/(M13)%20Hypothesis%20Testing%20for%20Means/(M13.4)%20Test%20for%20a%20Single%20Mean%20-%20Sigma%20Known/Resources/Table_A3.pdf) for the closest value to $0.1000$, you find $0.1003$ with the critical value of the Z score $-1.28$. Therefore, our critical value is $-1.28$.

As the picture below shows, the critical region includes any values of the test statistic less than $-1.28$.

Our test statistic of $-1.56$ falls _in_ the critical (_rejection_) region.

4. Make a Statistical Decision:

Since the test statistic falls inside the critical region, we _reject_ $H_{0}$.

5. State Conclusions:

The sample data supports the claim that the average cost of men's athletic shoes is less than $80.
