## Making the Decision

When we conduct a hypothesis test, we will make one of two decisions:

1. Reject the null hypothesis
2. Fail to reject the null hypothesis

Remember that the null is accepted as "true" unless proven otherwise. We collect a sample to see of we can find sufficient evidence to dispute the null hypothesis. After calculating a test statistic, we can use critical regions/values or a $p$-value to determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

### $p$-value Method

Using a significance level $\alpha$:

$$\mathrm{If~p-value} < \alpha, \mathrm{~reject~} H_{0}$$

This means that the probability of getting a test statistic equal to the one we got, or even farther away from the center of the curve is very small, where "small" is defined by the significance level; therefore, by the rare event rule, we determine that the null is false, and reject it.

$$\mathrm{If~p-value}>\alpha, \mathrm{~fail~to~reject} H_{0}$$

This means that the probability of getting a test statistic equal to the one we get, or even farther away from farther away from the center of the curve is not small enough to be considered rare when compared to the significance level; therefore, we don't have enough evidence to determine that the null is false.
