## Test Statistic: Variances Unknown but Equal

If the population standard deviations, $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$, are _unknown but equal_, then the test statistic is calculated as:

$$t=\frac{(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})-d_{0}}{s_{p}\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}} }}$$

where

$$s_{p}^2=\frac{(n_{1}-1)s_{1}^2+(n_{2}-1)s_{2}^2}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}$$

This test statistic has a $t$ Distribution with $\nu=n_{1}+n_{2}-2$ degrees of freedom, therefore, the critical values and $p$-values are calculated using [Table A.4](./Resources/Table_A4.pdf). The value $d_{0}$ comes from the null hypothesis.

### Example

**Problem:** A manufacturer claims that the average tensile strength of thread A exceeds the average tensile strength of thread B by at least 12 kilograms. To test this claim, 50 pieces of each type of thread were tested under similar conditions. Type A thread had an average tensile strength of 86.7 kilograms with a standard deviation of 6.28 kilograms, while type B thread had an average tensile strength of 77.8 kilograms with a standard deviation of 5.61 kilograms. Assume both distributions of tensile strength are normally distributed with a common variance. Calculate the test statistic for testing the manufacturer's claim.

**Solution:**

For this example, we are testing the hypotheses:

$$H_{0}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=12$$

$$H_{0}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>12$$

Sample data gives us

$$n_{1}=50$$

$$\overline x_{1}=86.7$$

$$s_{1}=6.28$$

$$n_{2}=50$$

$$\overline x_{2}=77.8$$

$$s_{2}=5.61$$

From the null hypothesis, $d_{0}=12$

We calculate the pooled sample variance as:

$$s_{p}^2=\frac{(n_{1}-1)s_{1}^2+(n_{2}-1)s_{2}^2}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}=\frac{(50-1)(6.28^2)+(50-1)(5.61^2)}{50+50-2}=35.45525$$

Therefore, $s_{p}=\sqrt{ s_{p}^2 }=\sqrt{ 35.45525 }=5.9544$

We calculate the test statistic as:

$$t=\frac{(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})-d_{0}}{s_{p}\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}} }}$$

$$t=\frac{(86.7-77.8)-12}{5.9544\sqrt{ \frac{1}{50}+\frac{1}{50} }}$$

$$t=-2.60$$

Therefore, our test statistic is $t=-2.60$.
