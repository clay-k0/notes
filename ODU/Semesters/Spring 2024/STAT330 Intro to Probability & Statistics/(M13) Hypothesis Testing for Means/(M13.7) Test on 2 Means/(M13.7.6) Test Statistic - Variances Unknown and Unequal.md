## Test Statistic: Variances Unknown and Unequal

If the population standard deviations, $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$, are _unknown and unequal_, then the test statistic is calculated as:

$$t'=\frac{(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})-d_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^2}{n_{1}}+\frac{s_{2}^2}{n_{2}}}}$$

This test statistic has a $t$ Distribution with degrees of freedom equal to

$$\nu=\frac{(\frac{s_{1}^2}{n_{1}}+\frac{s_{2}^2}{n_{2}})^2}{\frac{(\frac{s_{1}^2}{n_{1}})^2}{n_{1}-1}+\frac{(\frac{s_{2}^2}{n_{2}})^2}{n_{2}-1}}$$

This formula for $\nu$ typically is not an integer, so we round it down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, critical values and $p$-values are calculated using [Table A.4](./Resources/Table_A4.pdf). The value $d_{0}$ comes from the null hypothesis.

### Example

**Problem:** An experiment reported in Popular Science compared fuel economies for two types of similarly equipped diesel mini-trucks. Let us suppose that 12 Volkswagen and 10 Toyota trucks were tested in 90 kilometer-per-hour steady-paced trials. If the 12 Volkswagen trucks averaged 16 kilometers per liter with a standard deviation of 1.0 kilometer per liter and the 10 Toyota trucks averaged 11 kilometers per liter with a standard deviation of 0.8 kilometer per liter, calculate the test statistic needed in order to test the hypothesis that the fuel economy of Volkswagen mini-trucks, on average, exceeds that of similarly equipped Toyota mini-trucks by 4 kilometers per liter. You may not assume that the variances are equal.

**Solution:**

For this example, we are testing the hypotheses:

$$H_{0}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=4$$

$$H_{1}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>4$$

Sample data gives us

$$n_{1}=12$$

$$\overline x_{1}=16$$

$$s_{1}=1.0$$

$$n_{2}=10$$

$$\overline x_{2}=11$$

$$s_{2}=.8$$

From the null hypothesis, $d_{0}=4$

We calculate the test statistic as:

$$t'=\frac{(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})-d_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^2}{n_{1}}+\frac{s_{2}^2}{n_{2}}}}$$

$$t'=\frac{(16-11)-4}{\sqrt{ \frac{1.0^2}{12}+\frac{.8^2}{10} }}$$

$$t'=2.61$$

Thus, our test statistic is $t'=2.61$.
