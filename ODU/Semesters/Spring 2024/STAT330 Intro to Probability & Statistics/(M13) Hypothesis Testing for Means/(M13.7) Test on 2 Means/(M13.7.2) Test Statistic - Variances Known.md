## Test Statistic: Variances Known

The difference in sample means, $\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2}$ is the best point estimate for the difference in populations means, $\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}$. Similar to confidence intervals for the difference between 2 mens, the calculation of the test statistic depends on whether the population standard deviations, $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$, are known, unknown but equal, or unknown and unequal.

If the population standard deviations, $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$, are known, then the test statistic is calculated as:

$$Z=\frac{(\overline x_{1} - \overline x_{2})-d_{0}}{\sqrt{ \frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\frac{n_{1}+\sigma_{2}^2}{n_{2}}} }}$$

This test statistic has a Standard Normal Distribution, therefore critical values and $p$-values are calculated using [Table A.3](./Resources/Table_A3.pdf). The value $d_{0}$ comes from the null hypothesis.

### Example

**Problem:** A researcher is interested in species diversity of two different wetland areas. She claims that wetland 1 has higher species diversity than wetland 2. A random sample of size $n_{1}=25$, taken from wetland 1 has a mean of $\overline x_{1}=80$. A second random sample of size $\nu_{2}=36$, taken from a wetland 2 and has a mean of $\overline x_{2}=75$. Assume the population standard deviation for wetland 1 is $\sigma_{1}=5$ and the population standard deviation for wetland 2 is $\sigma_{2}=3$. Calculate the test statistic for testing the researches claim.

**Solution:**

For this example, we are testing the hypotheses:

$$H_{0}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0$$

$$H_{1}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>0$$

Sample data gives us

$$n_{1}=25$$

$$\overline x_{1}=80$$

$$n_{2}=36$$

$$\overline x_{2}=75$$

The population standard deviations are given to us as

$$\sigma_{1}=5$$
$$\sigma_{2}=3$$

From the null hypothesis, $d_{0}=0$. Thus, we calculate the test statistic as:

$$Z=\frac{(\overline x_{1} - \overline x_{2})-d_{0}}{\sqrt{ \frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\frac{n_{1}+\sigma_{2}^2}{n_{2}}} }}$$

$$Z=\frac{(80-75)-0}{\sqrt{ \frac{5^2}{\frac{25+3^2}{36}} }}$$

$$Z=4.47$$

Therefore, our test statistic is $Z=4.47$.
