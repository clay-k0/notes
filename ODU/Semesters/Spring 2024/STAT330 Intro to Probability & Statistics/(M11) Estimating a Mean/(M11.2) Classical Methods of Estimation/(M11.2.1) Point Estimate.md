## Point Estimate

A point estimate is a single value (or point) used to approximate a population parameter.

The sample mean, $\overline x$, is the best point estimate of a population mean.\
The sample mean, $\hat{p}$, is the best point estimate of a population proportion.\
The sample variance, $s^2$, is the best point estimate of a population variance.

| Population Parameter | Best Point Estimator |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| $\mu$                | $\overline x$        |
| $p$                  | $\hat{p}$            |
| $\sigma^2$           | $s^2$                |

In theory, a population parameter is often denoted as $\theta$ and the point estimate (or statistic) used to estimate it is $\hat{\theta}$.

We do not expect an estimator to estimate a population parameter without error. For example, the sample might be the best point estimate of the population mean; however, there are samples for which the sample median might be closer to the actual population mean.

### Example

For example, say we have a small population of 10 test scores: 
$64, 71, 73, 76, 79, 82, 88, 90, 91, 93$

**Population:** $64, 71, 73, 76, 79, 82, 88, 90, 91, 93$
The population mean for this population is $\mu=80.7$. Assume a sample of 3 test scores is randomly selected from this population.

**Sample 1:** $73,88,91$
This sample has a mean of $\overline x=4$ and a sample median of $\tilde{x}=88$. Here, the sample mean is closer to the true population mean than the sample median, thus the sample mean is the better estimator for sample 1.

**Sample 2:** $71,79,82$
This sample has a sample mean of $\overline x=77.333$ and a sample median of $\tilde{x}=79$. Here, the sample median is closer to the true population mean than the sample median, thus the sample median the better estimator for sample 2.

> This is an unusual example and often happens with skewed data. Generally, the best point estimate of the population mean is the **sample mean $\overline x$**.
