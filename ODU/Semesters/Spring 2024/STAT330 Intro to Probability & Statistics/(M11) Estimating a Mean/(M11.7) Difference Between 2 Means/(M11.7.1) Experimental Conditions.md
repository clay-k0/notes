## Experimental Conditions

Suppose there are two populations with means $\mu_{1}$ and $\mu_{2}$ and variances $\sigma_{1}^2$ and $\sigma_{2}^2$, respectively. A researcher may be interested in estimating the difference between the two means, say $\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}$. The best point estimate of this difference is $\overline x_{1}-\overline x _2$ where the sample means have been samples means have been calculated from two independent random samples, one from each population. 

For confidence interval estimation for the difference between two means, we assume the two random samples are independent (experimental conditions).

**Notation:** 

###### Sample from Population One:
- $n_{1}$ sample size for the first sample
- $\overline x_{1}$ sample mean for the first sample
- $s_{1}$ sample standard deviation for the first sample
- $\mu_{1}$ population mean for the population from which the first sample was drawn
- $\sigma_{1}$ population standard deviation for the population from which the first sample was drawn

###### Sample from Population Two:
- $n_{2}$ sample size for the second sample
- $\overline x_{2}$ sample mean for the second sample
- $s_{2}$ sample standard deviation for the second sample
- $\mu_{2}$ population mean for the population from which the second sample was drawn
- $\sigma_{2}$ population standard deviation for the population from which the second sample was drawn
