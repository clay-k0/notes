## Variances Unknown but Equal

Now consider the case where the _two population variances are unknown but equal_. Because the variances are equal we have $\sigma_{1}^2=\sigma_{2}^2=\sigma^2$ which gives us a standard normal variable by calculating

$$Z=\frac{(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2}-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})}{\sigma \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}} }}$$

The population variances, $\sigma^2$, are unknown, therefore we need to estimate $\sigma^2$ using the values from _both_ samples. We use a point estimate called the **pooled estimate of variance** by calculating the following 

$$s_{p}^2=\frac{(n_{1}-1)s_{1}^2+(n_{2}-1)s_{2}^2}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}$$

The pooled estimate of variance, $s_{p}^2$, is a weighted average of the two sample variances $s_{1}^2$ and $s_{2}^2$. The weights are the degrees of freedom from the chi-squared distribution of each sample variance.

One can show that with a $t$ distribution variable with $\nu=n_{1}+n_{2}-2$ degrees of freedom can be formed by substituting $s_{p}$ for $\sigma$ in our formula for $Z$ above

$$T=\frac{(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})}{s_{p}\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}} }}$$

This variable allows us to derive a confidence interval for the difference between two means when _each population variance is unknown but equal_ from our definition of $t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$

$$P(-t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}<T<t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}})=1-\alpha$$

$$\downarrow \mathrm{Substitute~T~from~above}$$

$$P\left( -t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}<\frac{(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})}{s_{p}\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n^2} }} <t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right)=1-\alpha$$

$$\downarrow \mathrm{Using~Algebra}$$

$$P\left[ (\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})-t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} s_{p} \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}}} < \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} <(\overline x_{1} - \overline x_{2})+t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}s_{p}\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}}} \right]=1-\alpha$$

**Definition:** If $\overline x_{1}$ and $\overline x_{2}$ are the means of independent random samples of sizes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ from populations with unknown but equal variances, $\sigma^2$, a $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for $\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}$ is given by

$$(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})-t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} s_{p} \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}}} < \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} <(\overline x_{1} - \overline x_{2})+t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}s_{p}\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}}}$$

where

$$s_{p}=\sqrt{ \frac{(n_{1}-1)s_{1}^2+(n_{2}-1)s_{2}^2}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2} }$$

and $t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is the $T$-value with an area of $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ to the right and $\nu=n_{1}+n_{2}-2$ degrees of freedom.

### Example

**Problem:** A measure of species diversity is made for water samples taken from two independent locations. The first location was a sample of $12$ measurements with a mean of $3.11$ and a standard deviation of $0.771$. The second location was a sample of $10$ measurements with a mean of $2.04$ and a standard deviation of $0.448$. Assume the measurements have normal distributions with a common variance. Find the $95\%$ confidence interval for the difference between species diversity in the two locations $\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}$

**Solution:**

$n_{1}=12$
$\overline x_{1}=3.11$
$s_{1}=0.771$

$n_{2}=10$
$\overline x_{2}=2.04$
$s_{2}=0.448$

Calculate $s_{p}^2$. the pooled estimate of variance:

$$s_{p}^2=\frac{(n_{1}-1)s_{1}^2+(n_{2}-1)s_{2}^2}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}=\frac{(12-1)(0.771^2)+(10-1)(0.448^2)}{12+10-2}=0.41725935$$

$s_{p}=\sqrt{ s_{p}^2 }=\sqrt{ 0.41725935 }=0.645956152$
$\nu=n_{1}+n_{2}-2=12+10-2=20$

$95\% \mathrm{~Confidence}\to \alpha=5\%=0.05$
$\frac{\alpha}{2}=0.025$

$t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}=2.086$ using [Table A.4](./Resources/Table%20A4%20-%20Critical%20Values%20of%20the%20t%20Distribution.pdf):

$$(x_{1}-x_{2})-t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}s_{p}\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}} }<\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})+t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}s_{p}\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}} }$$

$$(3.11-2.04)-2.086(0.645956152)\sqrt{ \frac{1}{12}+\frac{1}{10} }<\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<(3.11-2.04)+2.086(0.645956152)\sqrt{ \frac{1}{12}+\frac{1}{10} }$$

$$0.49<\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<1.65$$

> [!note]
> 
> In this example, the point estimate of $\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}$ is $\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2}=3.11-2.04=1.07$

Therefore, we can be $95\%$ confident that the interval between $0.49$ and $1.65$ contains the true difference between species diversity in the two locations $\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}$.

Because the confidence interval _does not contain zero_ and both limits are _positive_, we suspect that the species location $1, ~\mu_{1},$ is greater than the species diversity in location $2,~\mu_{2}$
