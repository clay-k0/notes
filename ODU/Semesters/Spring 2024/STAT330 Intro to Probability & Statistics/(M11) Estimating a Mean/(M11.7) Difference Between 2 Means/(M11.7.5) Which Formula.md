## Which Formula?

We just learned 3 different confidence intervals for when estimating the difference between two population means.

_How do you choose which one to use?_

### Known Population Variances

1. If. the population variances are _known_, use

$$(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{ \frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{n_{1}}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{n_{2}} }<\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})+Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{ \frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{n_{1}}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{n_{2}} }$$

where $Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is the $Z$-value with an area of $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ to the right.

### Unknown but Equal Population Variances

2. If the population variances are _unknown_, but can be assumed to be _equal_, use

$$(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})-t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}} }<\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})+t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}}}$$

where $t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is the $T$-value with an area of $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ to the right and $\nu=n_{1}+n_{2}-2$ degrees of freedom and $s_{p}^2=\frac{(n_{1}-1)s_{1}^2+(n_{2}-1)s_{2}^2}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}$

### Unknown and Unequal Population Variances

3. If the population variances are _unknown_ and _unequal_, use

$$(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})-t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{ \frac{s_{1}^2}{n_{1}}+\frac{s_{2}^2}{n_{2}} }<\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<(\overline x_{1}-\overline x_{2})+t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{ \frac{s_{1}^2}{n_{1}}+\frac{s_{2}^2}{n_{2}}}$$

where $t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is the $T$-value with an area of $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ to the right and $\nu=\frac{\left( \frac{s_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{s_{2}^2}{n_{2}}\right)^2}{\frac{\left(\frac{{s_{1}^2}}{n_{1}} \right)^2}{n_{1}-1}+\frac{\left(\frac{{s_{2}^2}}{n_{2}} \right)^2}{n_{2}-1}}$ degrees of freedom (if not an integer, rounded down to the nearest whole number)

> In this third case, there are other formulas that can be used to build a confidence interval. However, the formula presented is one of the most common choices for estimating the difference between two population means in the case of unknown and unequal variances.
