## Introduction

At the beginning of this course, we discussed the general philosophy of statistical inference. Statistical inference consists of methods used to make inferences or generalizations about a population. In the field of statistics, there are currently two types of estimation:

1. The **Frequentist approach** (classical method) of estimating a population parameter strictly uses information obtained from a random sample selected from the population.

1. The **Bayesian approach** (Bayesian method) of estimating a population parameter uses prior subjective knowledge about the probability distribution of the unknown parameters in conjunction with the information provided by the sample data.

## Bayesian vs. Frequentist Statistics

#### Example 1: Medical Diagnosis

Let's first start with an example dealing with a medical diagnosis. We can assume a person is visiting the doctor due to pain in their stomach. The doctor can take either a Bayesian or Frequentist approach to identifying the source of pain.

| Frequentist Approach                                                                                         | Bayesian Approach                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mental Model**<br><br>- To help identify different pain sources<br>                                        | **Model**<br><br>- To help identify different pain sources                                                                                                   |
| **Probing**<br><br>- The doctor uses his fingers to probe the patients stomach and get their feedback<br>    | **History**<br><br>- The doctor gets a background of the patient's experience with stomach problems<br>                                                      |
| **Identify**<br><br>- The doctor can then use the above information to diagnose the reason for the pain <br> | **Probing**<br><br>- The doctor uses his fingers to probe the patients stomach and get their feedback (while keeping both the model and history in mind)<br> |
|                                                                                                              | **Identify**<br><br>- The doctor can then use the above information to diagnose the reason for the pain                                                      |
#### Example 2: Locating a Submarine

Now, we want to find the location of a submarine by using echolocation from a ship on the surface.

| Frequentist Approach                                                                                                                   | Bayesian Approach                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**<br><br>- For identifying the location of the submarine based on the length of time and frequency of the signals received<br> | **Model**<br><br>- For identifying the location of the submarine based on the length of time and frequency of the signals received |
| **Locate**<br><br>- Use the data as an input to the model, then locate the submarine <br>                                              | **Prior Knowledge**<br><br>- i.e. understanding that submarine may have routes it frequently follows <br>                          |
|                                                                                                                                        | **Locate**<br><br>- Use the data and the prior knowledge as an input to the model, then locate the submarine                       |
For the purposes of this class, we will use classical methods of estimation (Frequentist approach) by computing statistics from random samples and applying the theory of sampling distributions covered in the previous module.
