### Introduction

At the beginning of this course, we discussed the general philosophy of statistical inference. Statistical inference consists of methods used to make inferences or generalizations about a population. In the field of statistics, there are currently two types of estimation:

1. The **classical method** (Frequentist approach) of estimating a population parameter strictly uses information obtained from a random sample selected from the population.

1. The **Bayesian method** (Bayesian approach) of estimating a population parameter uses prior subjective knowledge about the probability distribution of the unknown parameters in conjunction with the information provided by the sample data.
