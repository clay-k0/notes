## Estimation and Hypothesis Testing Overview

### Statistical Inference - Estimation 

A candidate for public office may wish to estimate the true proportion of voters favoring him by obtaining opinions from a random sample of 100 eligible voters. The fraction of voters in the sample favoring the candidate could be used as an estimate of the true proportion in the population of voters. A knowledge of the sample distribution of a proportion enables one to establish the degree of accuracy of such an estimate.

### Statistical Inference - Hypothesis Testing

Someone is interested in finding out whether brand A floor wax is more scuff-resistant than brand B floor wax. He or she might hypothesize that brand A is better than brand B, and after proper testing, reject or not reject this hypothesis. Here we are not attempting to estimate a parameter, but instead, we try to arrive at a correct decision about a stated hypothesis. Once again we are dependent on sampling theory and the use of data to provide us with some measure of accuracy for making our decision.
