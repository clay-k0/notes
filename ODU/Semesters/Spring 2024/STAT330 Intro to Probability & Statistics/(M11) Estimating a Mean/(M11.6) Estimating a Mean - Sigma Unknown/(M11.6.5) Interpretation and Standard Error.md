## Interpretation and Standard Error

We have already noted that the length or width of a confidence interval is determined by the **margin of error**. In the case of $\sigma$ unknown, the margin of error is

$$E=t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }} \right)$$

We also discussed how a higher confidence level results in a longer (or wider) confidence interval. The margin of error is also dependent on the sampling distribution of the point estimator. We can connect this back to our study of the [[(M10.2.2) Central Limit Theorem]] where we learned that the **standard error** of $\overline x$ is

$$s.e.(\overline x)=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}$$

also called standard deviation $\overline x$. We can now re-write the confidence interval formula as

$$\overline x-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }} \right)<\mu<\overline x+Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }} \right)$$

$$\downarrow$$

$$\overline x \pm Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}s.e.(\overline x)$$

The larger standard error, the longer a confidence interval.

When $\sigma$ is unknown and a normal distribution can be assumed, $s$ replaces $\sigma$ and the **estimated standard error** is used.

$$s.e.(\overline x)=\frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }}$$

This is often called "**standard errors**" by computer packages. Now, we can re-write the confidence interval formula as

$$\overline x-t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }} \right)<\mu<\overline x+t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }} \right)$$

$$\downarrow$$

$$\overline x \pm t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}s.e.(\overline x)$$

> The important concept here is that the _quality of an interval estimate is no better than the quality of the point estimate_, in this case the point estimates standard error. This is a prevailing notion as we develop more complicated confidence intervals - the widths of confidence intervals become shorter as the quality of the corresponding point estimates become better.
