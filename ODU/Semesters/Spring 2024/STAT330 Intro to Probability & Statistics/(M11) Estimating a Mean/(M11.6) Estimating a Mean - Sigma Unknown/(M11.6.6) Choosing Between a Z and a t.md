## Choosing Between a Z and a t

When computing the confidence interval for a population mean you have to choose whether you should use a $Z$ confidence interval or $t$ confidence interval. The key distinction is in the wording of the problem.

**Does the problem give you the population standard deviation?**

Every confidence interval for a mean must give you a standard deviation. If the standard deviation is a population standard deviation then the problem has to use the words "_population standard deviation_" or uses the symbol $\sigma$

If the population standard deviation is _known_, then use

$$\overline x-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }} \right)<\mu<\overline x+Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }} \right)$$

If the population standard deviation is _unknown_, then

$$\overline x-t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }} \right)<\mu<\overline x + t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }} \right)$$

It is common for statisticians to recommend that when $n\geq 30$ and $\sigma$ is unknown, $s$ can be used to replace $\sigma$ in the confidence interval

$$\overline x \pm Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }} \right)$$

This is even sometimes recommended when normality cannot be assumed. This is called a _large sample confidence interval_. One must use caution with this formula and emphasize that this is just an approximation and as $n$ gets larger the resulting interval estimate will get better.
