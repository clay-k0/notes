## Student $t$ Distribution Review

In [[(M10.5.1) t Distribution]], we were introduced to the $t$ distribution. We learned it is symmetric with mean, $\mu=0$ and is similar in shape to the standard normal distribution except for it has heavier tails than the standard normal deviation.

The distribution depends on the variables degrees of freedom, $\nu$. As $\nu \to \infty$, the $t$ distribution converges to the standard normal distribution. In an earlier module, we denoted a random variable with a $t$ distribution as $T$:

$$T=\frac{\overline x - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$

It has a $t$ distribution with mean $\nu = n - 1$ degrees of freedom. This property allows us to build confidence intervals for a population mean when the population standard deviation is unknown and is estimated by the sample standard deviation. We will keep the general format of building a confidence interval but change the critical value distribution from a standard normal distribution to the $t$ distribution.
