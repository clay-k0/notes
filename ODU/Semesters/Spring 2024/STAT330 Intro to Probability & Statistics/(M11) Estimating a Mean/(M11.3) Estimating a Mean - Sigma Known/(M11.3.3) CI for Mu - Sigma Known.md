#### Population Proportion Confidence Interval:

##### Requirements:

1. The sample is a random sample
2. The value of the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known
3. Either or both of the following conditions is satisfied: 
	a) The population is normally distributed
	b) The sample size is greater than 30, $n>30$

#### Confidence Interval for $\mu$ when $\sigma$ is known:

The sample mean, $\overline x$, is the most efficient estimator of the population mean. Recall from the [[(M10.2.2) Central Limit Theorem]], the sampling distribution of $\overline x$ is approximately normally distributed with a mean $\mu_{\overline x}=\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\overline x}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}$. Using our definition for $Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$, we can say

$$P(-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}<Z<Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}})=1-\alpha$$

where $Z=\frac{\overline x - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}}$ from the Central Limit Theorem.

Hence,

$$P(-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}<\frac{\overline x - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}}<Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}})=1-\alpha$$

Which is algebraically equivalent to 

$$P(\overline x-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}<\mu<\overline x+Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }})=1-\alpha$$

**Definition:** If $\overline x$ is the mean of the random sample of size $n$ from a population with known variance $\sigma^2$, a $100(1-\alpha)\%$  confidence interval for $\mu$ is given by

$$\overline x-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }})<\mu<\overline x+Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }})$$

where $Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is the Z-value with an area of $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ to the right.

Hence, we have defined $\hat{\theta}_{L}$ and $\hat{\theta}_{U}$ as

$$\hat{\theta}_{L}=\overline x-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }})$$

$$\hat{\theta}_{U}=\overline x+Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }})$$

This interval only applies if $n$ is larger than 30 or our population of interest is normally distributed. If a small sample is taken ($n<30$) from a non-normal population, we cannot use this confidence interval.
