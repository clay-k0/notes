## Binomial Approximation to the Hypergeometric

We have already stated that if objects are selected without replacement from a large population, then the successive draws are approximately independent. If the sample size is less than 5% of the population size, then the binomial distribution is usually a good approximation to the hypergeometric.

### Example:

Five items are selected at random, and without replacement, from the following population. Let $X$ equal the number of defectives in the sample of 5 items. Suppose the population size is 5000 items, of which 1000 are defective. Determine:

**a)** The exact value of $P(X=1)$
**b)** Use the binomial distribution to calculate $P(X=1)$

#### Solution:

**a)** $X$ is a hypergeometric distribution because we are sampling without replacement

$$P(X=1)=\frac{{1000 \choose 1}{4000 \choose 4}}{5000 \choose 5}=0.4098$$

**b)** Using the [binomial table](obsidian://open?vault=ODU%20Spring%202024&file=STAT330%20Intro%20to%20Probability%20%26%20Statistics%2F(M.7)%20Discrete%20Probability%20Distributions%20-%20Part%201%2FTable%20A1%20-%20Binomial%20Probability%20Sums.pdf) with $n=5$ and $p=\frac{1000}{5000}=0.2$

$$P(X=1)=P(X\leq 1)-P(X\leq 0)=F(1)-F(0)$$

$$=0.7373-0.3277=0.4096$$

> [!Note]
>The binomial is a good approximation in this case because it is accurate to the tenth of a percent. This approximation works because the sample size of 5 was less than 5% of the population size of 5000.
