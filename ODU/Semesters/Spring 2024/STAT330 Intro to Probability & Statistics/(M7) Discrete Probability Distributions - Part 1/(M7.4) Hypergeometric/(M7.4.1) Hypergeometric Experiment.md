## Hypergeometric Experiment

The binomial and multinomial experiments require independent trials. The hypergeometric and multivariate hypergeometric distributions are very similar; however, they occur when sampling without replacement from a small population yielding dependent trials.

A **hypergeometric experiment** must satisfy the following requirements:
- A sample size of size $n$ is selected **_without replacement_** from a population of $N$ objects.
- The population contains 2 kinds of objects, having attributes that we call _Success_ and _Failure_.
- The main interest of the experiment is to count the number of objects in the sample that have the attribute of _Success_.

We call this random variable, $X$ = to the number of objects in the sample that have the attribute of success, a **hypergeometric random variable**.
