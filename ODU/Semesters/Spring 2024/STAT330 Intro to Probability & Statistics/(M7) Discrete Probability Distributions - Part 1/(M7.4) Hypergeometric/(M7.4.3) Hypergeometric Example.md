## Hypergeometric Example

### Example

To control the quality of outgoing items, five items are randomly selected, without replacement, from each lot. A lot is rejected if one or more defectives are found. Let $X$ equal the number of defectives in the sample of 5 items. Suppose a lot of 50 items contains 10 defectives.

**a)** Find the expected number of defectives in the sample for this lot
**b)** Find the variance for the number of defectives in the sample for this lot
**c)** Calculate the probability that this lot is rejected

#### Solution

$X$ is a hypergeometric distribution with $N=50, k=10,~ and ~n=5$

**a)** 

$p=\frac{k}{p}=\frac{10}{50}=0.2$

E($X$) (mean/expected) = $np=(5)(.2)=1$

We expect one item in the sample to be defective. Because a lot is rejected if one defective is found, we expect to reject this lot.

**b)**

$Var(X)=\frac{{N-n}}{N-1}npq=\frac{{50-5}}{50-1}(5)(0.2)(0.8)=0.735$

**c)**

$P$(lot is rejected) = $P(X\geq 1)=1-f(0)$

$f(x)=\frac{{k \choose x}{N-k \choose n-x}}{N \choose n}$

$f(0)=\frac{{10 \choose 0}{50-10 \choose 5-0}}{50 \choose 5}=0.3106$

$P($lot is rejected) = $1-0.3106=68.94\%$
