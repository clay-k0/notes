## Multinomial Experiments

While a binomial probability distribution allows one to deal with circumstances in which the outcomes belong to two relevant categories, a multinomial distribution allows one to deal with experiments in which there are more than two relevant outcomes.

A **multinomial experiment** must satisfy the following requirements:

- The experiment consists of $n$ independent and identical (iid) trials.
- Each trial has $k$ possible mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes, denoted $A_{1},A_{2},\dots,A_{k}$.
- The per trial probability, $p_{i}=P(A_{i})$, that outcome $A_{i}$ occurs must remain constant from trial to trial.
- The main interest of the experiment is to count the number of times each outcome occurs.

We set $X_{i}$ equal to the number of times the outcome $A_{i}$ occurs in the $n$ trials for $i=1,2,\dots,k$.

The joint probability distribution of $X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{k}$ is called the **multinomial distribution**.
