Let $X_{i}$ be the number of objects of type $A_{i}$ in the sample $i=1,2,\dots,k$; then, the joint probability distribution for $X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{k}$ is called a multivariate hypergeometric distribution.

The population has $N$ total items, of which there are $N_{1}$ of type $A_{1}$, $N_{2}$ of type $A_{2},\dots$, and $N_{k}$ of type $A_{k}$.

**Population:**

| Type of Object | Number |
| ---- | ---- |
| $A_{1}$ | $N_{1}$ |
| $A_{2}$ | $N_{2}$ |
| $A_{k}$ | $N_{k}$ |
| Total: | $N$ |
**Sample:**

| Type of Object | Number |
| ---- | ---- |
| $A_{1}$ | $x_{1}$ |
| $A_{2}$ | $x_{2}$ |
| $A_{k}$ | $x_{k}$ |
| Total: | $n$ |

Using counting and probability rules, we can develop the following joint probability distribution for $X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{k}$
$$f(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{k}) = P({sample~contains~exactly~x_{1}~objects~of~type~A_{1}, \choose x_{2}~objects~of~type~A_{2},\dots,~and~x_{k}~objects~of~type~x_{k}})$$
$$f(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{k})=\frac{{N_{1} \choose x_{1}}{N_{2}\choose x_{2}}\dots {N_{k} \choose x_{k}}}{N \choose n}$$
where $N=N_{1}+N_{2}+\dots+N_{k}$ and $x_{1}+x_{2}+\dots+x_{k}=n$

In the formula, there are $N_{1}$ of type $A_{1}$ in the population, from which we want to choose $x_1$ to be in our sample, $N_{1} \choose x_{1}$. There are $N_2$ of type $A_{2}$ in the population, from which we want to choose $x_{2}$ to be in our sample, $N_{2} \choose x_{2}$… There are $N_{k}$ of type $A_{k}$ in the population, from which we want to choose $x_{k}$ to be in our sample, $N_{k} \choose x_{k}$, and the experiment consists of taking a population of $N$ items and choosing $n$ of them, without replacement, $N \choose n$.

The marginal distribution of each $X_{i}$ is a hypergeometric random variable with
$$E(X_{i})=np_{i}$$$$~Var(X_{i})=\frac{{N-n}}{N-1}np_{i}q_{i}$$
where $p_{i}=\frac{N_{i}}{N}~and~q_{i}=1-p_{i}$
