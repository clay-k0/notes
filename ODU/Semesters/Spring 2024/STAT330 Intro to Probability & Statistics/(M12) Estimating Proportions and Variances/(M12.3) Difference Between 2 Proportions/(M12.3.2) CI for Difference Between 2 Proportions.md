## Confidence Interval for Difference Between 2 Proportions

One can show that the variable

$$Z=\frac{(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2})-(p_{1}-p_{2})}{\sqrt{ \frac{\frac{p_{1} q_{1}}{n_{1}+p_{2}q_{2}}}{n_{2}} }}$$

has a normal distribution.

This variable allows us to derive a confidence interval for the difference between two proportions when choosing independent samples from our definition of $Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$

$$P\left( -Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} < Z < Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \right)=1-\alpha$$

$$\downarrow \mathrm{~substitute~Z}$$

$$P\left( -Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} < Z=\frac{(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2})-(p_{1}-p_{2})}{\sqrt{ \frac{\frac{p_{1} q_{1}}{n_{1}+p_{2}q_{2}}}{n_{2}} }} < Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \right)=1-\alpha$$

$$\downarrow \mathrm{~using~algebra }$$

$$P\left[ (\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2})-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{ \frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{\frac{n_{1}+p_{2}q_{2}}{n_{2}}} }<p_{1}-p_{2}< (\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2})+Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{ \frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{\frac{n_{1}+p_{2}q_{2}}{n_{2}}} }\right]=1-\alpha$$

Replacing $p_{1},p_{2},q_{1}$, and $q_{2}$ values under the radicals with their estimates, $\hat{p}_{1},\hat{p}_{2},\hat{q}_{1}$, and $\hat{q}_{2}$ gives us the formula for calculating a **Large-Sample Confidence Interval for** $p_{1}-p_{2}$.

**Definition:** If $\hat{p}_{1}$ and $\hat{p}_{2}$ are the proportions of successes in random samples of sizes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$, respectively, $\hat{q}_{1}=1-\hat{p}_{1}$ and $\hat{q}_{1}=1-\hat{p}_{1}$, an approximate $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for the difference of two binomial parameters, $p_{1}-p_{2}$, is given by

$$(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2})-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_{1}\hat{q}_{1}}{n_{1}} + \frac{\hat{p}_{2}\hat{q}_{2}}{n_{2}}}<p_{1}-p_{2}<(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2})+Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_{1}\hat{q}_{1}}{n_{1}} + \frac{\hat{p}_{2}\hat{q}_{2}}{n_{2}}}$$

where $Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is the $Z$-value with an area of $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ to the right.

We can use this formula if the sample sizes are large enough so that all of the following values are greater than or equal to 5:

- $n_{1}\hat{p}_{1}$
- $n_{1}\hat{q}_{1}$
- $n_{1}\hat{p}_{2}$
- $n_{1}\hat{q}_{2}$

### Examples

**Problem:** A plant manager wants to compare the proportions of defective items produced by two different manufacturing methods. A random sample of 150 items was taken from Method 1 with 15 defectives in the sample. A random sample of 200 items was taken from Method 2 with 28 defectives in the sample. Find a $99\%$ confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of defectives, $p_{1}-p_{2}$.

**Solution:**

$n_{1}=150$\
$X_{1}=15$ defectives\
$\hat{p}_{1}=\frac{X_{1}}{n_{1}}=\frac{15}{150}=0.10$\
$\hat{q}_{1}=1-\hat{p}_{1}=0.90$

$n_{2}=200$\
$X_{2}=28$ defectives\
$\hat{p}_{2}=\frac{X_{2}}{n_{2}}=\frac{28}{200}=0.14$\
$\hat{q}_{2}=1-\hat{p}_{2}=0.86$

$99\% \mathrm{~Confidence}\to Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}=2.575}$

$$(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2})-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_{1}\hat{q}_{1}}{n_{1}} + \frac{\hat{p}_{2}\hat{q}_{2}}{n_{2}}}<p_{1}-p_{2}<(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2})+Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_{1}\hat{q}_{1}}{n_{1}} + \frac{\hat{p}_{2}\hat{q}_{2}}{n_{2}}}$$

$$(0.10-0.14)-2.575\sqrt{ \frac{(0.10)(0.90)}{150}+\frac{(0.14)(0.86)}{200} }<p_{1}-p_{2}<(0.10-0.14)+2.575\sqrt{ \frac{(0.10)(0.90)}{150}+\frac{(0.14)(0.86)}{200} }$$

$$-0.04-2.575\sqrt{ 0.001202 }<p_{1}-p_{2}<-0.04+2.575\sqrt{ 0.001202 }$$

$$-0.129<p_{1}-p_{2}<0.049$$

> [!note]
> 
> In this example, the point estimate of $p_{1}-p_{2}$ is $\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}=0.10-0.14=-0.04$

Thus, one can be $99\%$ confident that the interval between $-0.129$ and $0.049$ contains the true difference in proportions, $p_{1}-p_{2}$.

Because the confidence interval contains zero, we suspect that $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are equal, i.e. no difference in the proportion of defective items produced by the two manufacturing methods.
