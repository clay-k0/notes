## Experimental Conditions

Suppose there are two populations with population proportions, $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$. A researcher may be interest in estimating the difference between the two proportions, say $p_{1}-p_{2}$. The best point estimate of this different is $\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}$ where the sample proportions have been calculated from two independent random samples, one from each population.

To estimate the confidence interval for the difference between two means, we assume two random samples are independent (experimental conditions).

### Notation

#### Population One

| Symbol                            | Meaning                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $n_{1}$                           | Sample Size (First Sample)                                    |
| $\hat{p}_{1}$                     | Sample Proportion (First Sample)                              |
| $\hat{p}_{1}=\frac{X_{1}}{n_{1}}$ | Where $X_{1}$ is the number of _Success_ items (First Sample) |
| $\hat{q}_{1}=1-\hat{p}_{1}$       | Sample Proportion Complement (First Sample)                   |

#### Population Two

| Symbol                            | Meaning                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $n_{2}$                           | Sample Size (Second Sample)                                    |
| $\hat{p}_{2}$                     | Sample Proportion (Second Sample)                              |
| $\hat{p}_{2}=\frac{X_{2}}{n_{2}}$ | Where $X_{2}$ is the number of _Success_ items (Second Sample) |
| $\hat{q}_{2}=1-\hat{p}_{2}$       | Sample Proportion Complement (Second Sample)                   |
