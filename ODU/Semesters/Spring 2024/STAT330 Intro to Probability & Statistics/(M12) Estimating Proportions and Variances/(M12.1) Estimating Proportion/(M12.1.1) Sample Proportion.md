## Sample Proportion

Remember, a **point estimate** is a single value (or point) used to approximate a population parameter. The sample proportion $\hat{p}$ is the best point estimate of the population proportion, $p$.

$p$ = population proportion
$\hat{p}$ = sample proportion

For a sample proportion,

$$\hat{p}=\frac{X}{n}\mathrm{~and~}\hat{q}=\frac{n-X}{n}=1-\hat{p}$$


where $X$ is the number of sample units that possess the characteristic of interest and $n$ is the sample size.

We interpret $\hat{p}$ as the proportion of units in the sample that have some characteristic of interest and $\hat{q}$ as the proportion of the sample that does not have the characteristic of interest. Therefore, $\hat{p}$ and $\hat{q}$ are complementary events which we can see in the formulas above.

### Example

**Problem:** In a recent survey of $150$ households, $54$ had central air conditioning. Find $\hat{p}$ and $\hat{q}$, where $\hat{p}$ is the proportion of households that have central air conditioning.

**Solution:** Since the characteristic is central air conditioning, $54$ households in the sample had central air conditioning, $X=54$, and the sample size is $150$ households, $n=150$

$$\hat{p}=\frac{X}{n}=\frac{54}{150}=0.36=36\%$$

$$\hat{q}=1-\hat{p}=1-0.36=0.64=64\%$$
