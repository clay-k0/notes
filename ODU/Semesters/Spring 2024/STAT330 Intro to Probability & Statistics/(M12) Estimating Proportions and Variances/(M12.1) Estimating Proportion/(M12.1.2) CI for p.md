### Calculating a Confidence Interval for a Population Proportion

#### Requirements

The three requirements to calculate a CI for $p$ are

1. The sample size is a random sample
2. There is a fixed number of trials, the trials are independent, there are two categories of outcomes for each trial, and the probability of success per trial remains constant
3. There are at least 5 successes and at least 5 failures in the sample

#### Procedure

The sample proportion, $\hat{p}$, is the most efficient estimator of the population proportion. Using the expected value of $\hat{p}$, the variance of $\hat{p}$, and the Central Limit Theorem, one can show that the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is approximately normally distributed with a mean $\mu_{\hat{p}}=p$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n} }$. Using our definition for $Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$, we can write

$$P\left( -Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} < Z < Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \right)=1-\alpha$$

where $Z=\frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n} }}$

Hence,

$$P\left( -Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} < \frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n} }} < Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right)=1-\alpha$$

which is algebraically equivalent to

$$P\left( \hat{p}-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n} } < p > \hat{p} + Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n} } \right)=1-\alpha$$

- - -

**Definition:** If $\hat{p}$ is a sample proportion, a $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for the corresponding population proportion, $p$, is given by

$$\hat{p}-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n} } < p > \hat{p} + Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n} }$$

where $Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is the $Z$-value with an area of $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ to the right.

Thus, we have defined $\hat{\theta}_{L}$ and $\hat{\theta}_{U}$ as

$$\hat{\theta}_{L}=\hat{p}-Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n} }$$

$$\hat{\theta}_{U}=\hat{p}+Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n} }$$
