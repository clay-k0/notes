## Confidence Interval for the Ratio of 2 Variances Examples

#### Example 1

**Problem:** A measure of species diversity is made for water samples taken from two independent locations. The first location was a sample of $13$ measurements with a mean of $3.11$ and standard deviation of $0.771$. The second location was a sample of $10$ measurements with a mean of $2.04$ and a standard deviation of $0.448$. Assume the each location measurements has a normal distribution. Find $90\%$ confidence interval for the ratio of the two variances, $\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2}$.

**Solution:**

$n_{1}=13$\
$s_{1}=0.771$ (Sample Standard Deviation)\
$s_{1}^2=(0.771)^2=0.594441$ (Variance)

$n_{2}=10$\
$s_{2}=0.448$ (Sample Standard Deviation)\
$s_{1}^2=(0.448)^2=0.200704$ (Variance)

Find the critical values:
1. $\alpha=1-\mathrm{Confidence~Level}=1-0.90=0.10$
2. $\frac{\alpha}{2}=\frac{0.10}{2}=0.05$
3. $\nu_{1}=n_{1}-1=13-1=12$ and $\nu_{2}=n_{2}-1=10-1=9$
4. Use [Table A.6](./Resources/Table_A6.pdf) to find $f_{0.05}(12,9)$ and $f_{0.05}(9,12)$
	- $f_{0.05}(12,9)$: At $\nu_{1}=12$, $\nu_{2}=9$, and $\alpha=0.05$, we find the critical value $3.07$
	-  $f_{0.05}(9,12)$: At $\nu_{1}=9$, $\nu_{2}=12$, and $\alpha=0.05$, we find the critical value $2.80$

The critical values are $f_{0.05}(12,9)=3.07$ and $f_{0.05}(9,12)=2.80$, so

$$\frac{s_{1}^2}{s_{2}^2}\frac{1}{f_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}(\nu_{1},\nu_{2})}<\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2}<\frac{s_{1}^2}{s_{2}^2}f_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}(\nu_{2},\nu_{1})$$

$$\frac{0.594441}{0.200704}\frac{1}{3.07}<\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2}<\frac{0.594441}{0.200704}2.80$$

$$0.94<\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2}<8.29$$

Thus, one can be $90\%$ confident that the interval between $0.94$ and $8.29$ contains the true ratio population variances.

#### Example 2

**Problem:** Based on the samples in Example 1, calculate a $90\%$ confidence interval for the ratio of the two population standard deviations, $\frac{\sigma_{1}}{\sigma_{2}}$.

**Solution:**

$$\sqrt{ \frac{s_{1}^2}{s_{2}^2}\frac{1}{f_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}(\nu_{1},\nu_{2})}}<\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2}<\sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^2}{s_{2}^2}f_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}(\nu_{2},\nu_{1})}$$

$$\sqrt{\frac{0.594441}{0.200704}\frac{1}{3.07}}<\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2}<\sqrt{\frac{0.594441}{0.200704}2.80}$$

$$0.90<\frac{\sigma_{1}}{\sigma_{2}}<2.88$$
