A random variable, $X$, has a **normal distribution** with 
- mean $= \mu$
- standard deviation = $\sigma$ 
if the PDF of $X$ is
$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2\pi \sigma }} e^{\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}},~-\infty < x < \infty$$

**Properties:**
- The normal distribution curve is **bell-shaped**
- The normal distribution is **unimodal** (has only one mode)
- The **mean**, **median**, and **mode** are equal and located at the **center** of the distribution
- The curve is **symmetric** about the **mean** (the left and right sides of the center are **identical**)
- The curve is **continuous** without any gaps or holes
- The curve has a **horizontal asymptote** at the horizontal axis ($y=0$). Theoretically, no matter how far to the right or the left of the center, the curve **never meets the x-axis**, but it gets increasingly closer.
- The **total area** under the normal distribution curve is 1 (or $100\%$)

Different normal distributions can have the **same means** but **different standard deviations**

Different normal distributions can have the **same standard deviation** but **different means**

And, different normal distributions can have **different means** and **different standard deviations**

Since the area underneath a continuous distribution curve is equivalent to a probability, then the probability that a normally distributed random variable, $X$, is less than $a$ would be:
$$P(X<a)=\int _{-\infty} ^a \frac{\,1}{\sqrt{ 2\pi \sigma }} e^{- \frac {(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} dx $$
You can use statistical software to solve this problem, but calculation by hand is not quick. Instead, we use a table of cumulative distribution values for a specific normal distribution called the standard normal distribution to solve any normal distribution problem.
