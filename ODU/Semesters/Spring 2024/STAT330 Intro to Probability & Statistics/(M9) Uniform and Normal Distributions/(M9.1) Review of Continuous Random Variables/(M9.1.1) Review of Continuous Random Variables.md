Remember, a random variable is **continuous** if it can take on values in a continuous subset of the real numbers. Examples of continuous random variables include height, weight, distance, time, and temperature.

The requirements of a continuous probability distribution function (PDF) are:

1. $f(x)\geq 0$ for all $x$
2. $\int ^{\infty}_{-\infty} \, f(x)dx =1$
3. $P(a<X<b)=\int _{a} ^b \, f(x) dx$

In other words, the entire area between the PDF and the x-axis is 1. We call this the area underneath the curve. The probability that $X$ is between $a$ and $b$ is the area underneath the curve between the limits $a$ and $b$.
