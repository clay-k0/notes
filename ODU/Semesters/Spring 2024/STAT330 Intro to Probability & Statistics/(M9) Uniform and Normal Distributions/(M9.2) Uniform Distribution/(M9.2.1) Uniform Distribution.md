When the probability for a continuous random variable is evenly distributed across all real values between limits $a$ and $b$, we call this a **continuous uniform distribution** (similar to a discrete uniform).
$$f(x;a,b)=\frac{1}{b-a},~a\leq x\leq b$$
The distribution is characterized by a PDF that is "flat" forming a rectangle with a constant height of $\frac{1}{b-a}$ between the limits $a$ and $b$.

Probabilities are easy to calculate for a uniform distribution because we know the area under a rectangle is equal to the product of the rectangle's length and width (Area = $L \times H$).

### Example
Assume the continuous random variable $X$ is uniformly distributed between 1 and 5. Find $P(X>2)$.

### Solution
The height of the distribution is $\frac{1}{b-a}=\frac{1}{5-1}=\frac{1}{4}$

The probability that $X$ is greater than 2 is the area of the rectangle between 2 and 5.

$P(X>2)=L \times H=(5-2) \times \frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$
