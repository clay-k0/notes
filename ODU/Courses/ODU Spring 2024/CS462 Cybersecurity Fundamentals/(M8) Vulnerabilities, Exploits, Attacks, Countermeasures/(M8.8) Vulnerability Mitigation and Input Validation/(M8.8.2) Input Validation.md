- Buffer overflow can occur with any kind of input
	- Input validation is the best practice for secure software development
- Validation of input should encompass size, format, and type
	- If the input is for a local variable of a dynamic type, the size should be included
		- This is, for example, the case for variables containing strings
- If the input is in file form, the file type and size must be validated
	- For example, a text file requirement should be checked against other forms
- Lastly, the input type should be validated
	- If a user is to enter the date as a string of 8 characters, the range of characters should be validated
- Programming languages like Java and Ada95 have built-in input validation
