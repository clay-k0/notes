Vulnerability databases provide a common point of collecting, archiving and disseminating information about vulnerabilities. There are many vulnerability databases.

### Common Vulnerability Databases
- **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)** is the leading one
    - It is part of NIST’s Computer Security Resource Center
- **Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVD)**
    - Provided documentation for over 100,000 vulnerabilities during 2004 and 2016.
    - Non-active since April 2016 and only blogs used for discussions.
- **Common Weaknesses Enumeration (CWE)**
    - Over 600 software weaknesses in software development
    - A number of Government (US and foreign) and industry partners participate
-  **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)** is synchronized with the CVE list
    - NVD has fixes for each vulnerability
- NVD also includes **security content automation protocol (SCAP)**
    - SCAP performs tasks such as automatic vulnerability management, and policy compliance evaluation, such as with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
    - SCAP uses CVE as a standard for evaluating software problems’ impact
- CVE is required for the **Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)**
    - International Telecommunications Union (ITU) adopted it as X.5120

**Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)**
- An architecture for cataloging attack patterns incorporating CWE, CVE, OVAL...
- See CAPEC publication by MITRE in the Resources

### Attack Pattern Examples
- HTTP response splitting SQL injection
- XSS in HTTP query strings Session fixation Phishing
- Filter failure through buffer overflow Subvert code-signing facilities
- Reflection attack in an authentication protocol
- Cause web server misclassification Rainbow table password cracking
- Forced deadlock Cache poisoning Restful privilege escalation
