### Inverse Functions
**Definition**: Assume $f$ is a **bijective** function from $A$ to $B$. Then, the **inverse** of $f$, denoted by $f^{-1}$ is the function from $B$ to $A$ defined as:
$$f^{-1}(y) = x \iff f(x) = y$$
$$Remember: \iff~is~if~and~only~if$$
**No** inverse exists **unless** $f$ is a bijection. Why? 
In an inverse function, the codomain B must be mapped and it can only occur once. Remember, bijective = injective and surjective.

##### Example
![[inverse_function.png]]
In $f$, we have 
- $a \to Y$
- $b \to W$
- $c \to X$
- $d \to V$

Contrarily, $f^{-1}$ contains
- $Y \to a$
- $W \to b$
- $X \to c$
- $V \to c$

### Additional Examples

##### Example 1:
Let $f$ be the function from $\{a,b,c\}$ to $\{1,2,3\}$ such that $f(a) = 2,f(b)=3$, and $f(c)=1$. Is $f$ invertible and if so what is its inverse?

$A = \{a,b,c\}$
$B = \{1,2,3\}$ 

| $f$ |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| $A$ | $B$ |
| **a** | 1 |
| *b*<br> | **2** |
| c | *3* |
$a \to 2$ or $f(a) = 2$
$b \to 3$ or $f(b) = 3$
$c \to 1$ or $f(c) = 1$

Yes, the given function is bijective, and is therefore invertible:

| $f^{-1}$ |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| $A$ | $B$ |
| **a** | 1 |
| *b* | **2** |
| c | *3* |
$2 \to a$ or $f(2) = a$
$3 \to b$ or $f(3) = b$
$1 \to c$ or $f(1) = c$


##### Example 2:
Let $f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(x) = x + 1$. Is $f$ invertible, and if so, what is its inverse?

Yes, the function is invertible. The inverse can shown as:

$f^{-1} (y)= y-1$

##### Example 3:
Let $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = x^2$. Is $f$ invertible, and if so, what is its inverse?

y=x^2

Notice that the entire portion below the x-axis is unused. 

The function is neither onto nor one-to-one, meaning it is **not** bijective. Thus, it is **not** invertible.
