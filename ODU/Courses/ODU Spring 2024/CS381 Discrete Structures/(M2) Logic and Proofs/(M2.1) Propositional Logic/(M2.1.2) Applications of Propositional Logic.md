### Translating English Sentences
Build **expressions** involving *propositional variables* and *logical connectives* - *Why?*

1. To **remove ambiguity** from the sentences
2. To analyze the logical expressions and determine their truth values
3. To use **rules of inference** to reason about them


#### The Steps:
1. Identify atomic propositions and represent using propositional variables (name the variables).
2. Determine the appropriate logical connectives.

#### Example 1:
"If I go to Harry's or to the city, I will not go shopping."

**Step 1:**
 * *p* = I go to Harry's
 * *q* = I go to the city
 * *r* = I will go shopping
**Step 2:**
* If *p* or *q*, then not *r*
* (*p*∨*q*)-->¬*r*

#### Example 2:
"You can access the Internet from campus **only if** you are a computer science major or you are not a freshman."

**Step 1:**
- *a* = You can access the Internet from campus
- *c* = You are a computer science major
- *f* = You are a freshman
**Step 2:**
- *a* only if *c* or not f
- *a*-->(*c*∨¬*f*)

#### Example 3:
"The automated reply cannot be sent when the file system is full."

**Step 1:**
- *s* = The automated reply can be sent
- *f* = The file system is full
**Step 2:**
- not *s* when *f*
- *f*-->¬*s*
