## Theorem: 
Let $X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{k}$ be be independent random variables each having a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom $\nu_{i},~i=1,2,\dots,k$ . Then $Y=X_{1}+X_{2}+\dots+X_{k}$ is a random variable that has a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to $\nu_{1}+\nu_{2}+\dots+\nu_{k}$.

### Examples of Random Variables
- If $Z$ has a standard normal distribution, then $W=Z^2$ has a chi-square distribution with $df=1$.
- If $Z_{1},Z_{2},\dots, Z_{k}$ are independent random variables that have standard normal distributions, then $W=Z_{1}^2,Z_{2}^2,\dots,Z_{k}^2$

### Sample Distribution of $s^2$
Recall that the sample variance is given by $$s^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i}-{\overline x})^2}{n-1}$$
Thus, $$\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i}-{\overline x})^2}{\sigma^2}~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~(1)$$
If $X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{k}$ are independent and identical normally distributed random variables with mean = $\mu$ and standard deviation = $\sigma$, then $$z_{i}=\frac{x_i-\mu}{\sigma}~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~i=1,2,\dots,n$$
have standard normal distributions and $$z_{1}^2+z_{2}^2+\dots+z_{n}^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i}-{\overline x})^2}{\sigma^2}~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~(2)$$
has a chi-square distribution with $n$ degrees of freedom.

Both $(1)$ and $(2)$ have chi-square distributions. Specifically, $(1)$ has a chi-square distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. We say that one degree of freedom has been lost by replacing $\mu$ in $(2)$ with $\overline x$.

## Theorem Takeaway: 
If $s^2$ is the variance of a random sample, $X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{n}$, of size $n$ from a normal distribution with variance = $\sigma^2$, then $$\chi^2=\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2}$$
has a chi-square distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
