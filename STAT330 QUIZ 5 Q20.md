## STAT330 Quiz 5 #20

**Problem:** A biologist who studies spiders was interested in comparing the lengths of female and male green lynx spiders. She collects two samples and calculates the confidence interval for the difference in mean length to be $3.21<\mu_{\mathrm{female}-\mu_{\mathrm{male}}}<-1.83.$

Based on the this confidence interval, which statement is true?

**Solution:** Here's a trick for questions asking what can be concluded from 2 given samples:

| Interval Result            | Conclusion      |
| -------------------------- | --------------- |
| Both Positive Values       | $p_{1}>p_{2}$   |
| Both Values Negative       | $p_{1}<p_{2}$   |
| One Positive, One Negative | Cannot conclude |

Observing $p_{1}=3.21$ to $p_{2}=-1.83$, we notice that one value is positive, while the other is negative.

Therefore, _we suspect the average length of male green lynx spiders to be longer than the average length of female green lynx_.
