**Problem:** A biologist who studies spiders was interested in comparing the lengths of female and male green lynx spiders. She collects two samples and calculates the confidence interval for the difference in mean length to be $3.21<\mu_{\mathrm{female}-\mu_{\mathrm{male}}}<-1.83.$

Based on the this confidence interval, which statement is true?

**Solution:** Here's a trick to questions that ask what can be concluded when given 2 samples:

| Interval Result            | Conclusion      |
| -------------------------- | --------------- |
| Both Positive Values       | $p_{1}>p_{2}$   |
| Both Values Negative       | $p_{1}<p_{2}$   |
| One Positive, One Negative | Cannot conclude |

Therefore, _we suspect the average length of male green lynx spiders to be longer than the average length of female green lynx_.
