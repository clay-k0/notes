## Grouping Types

### A Common Problem

Many programmers with an OOP background tend to encounter the following issue:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Animal contains all the base fields for animals
type Animal struct {
	Name     string
	IsMammal bool
}

// Speak provides generic behavior for all animals and
// how they speak
func (a *Animal) Speak() {
	fmt.Printf("I'm %s and it's %t that I'm a mammal", a.Name, a.IsMammal)
}

// Dog contains both Animal and dog-specific capabilities
type Dog struct {
	Animal
	PackFactor int
}

// Speak knows how to speak like a dog
func (d *Dog) Speak() {
	fmt.Printf("Woof! I'm %s, it's %t that I'm a mammal, and I have a pack factor of %d", d.Name, d.IsMammal, d.PackFactor)
}

// Cat contains both Animal and cat-specific capabilities
type Cat struct {
	Animal
	ClimbFactor int
}

// Speak knows how to speak like a cat
func (c *Cat) Speak() {
	fmt.Printf("Meow! I'm %s, it's %t that I'm a mammal, and I have a climb factor of %d", c.Name, c.IsMammal, c.ClimbFactor)
}

func main() {
	animals := []Animal{
		Dog{
			Animal: Animal{
				Name: "Ace",
				IsMammal: true,
			},
			PackFactor: 5,
		},
		Cat{
			Animal: Animal{
				Name: "Juno",
				IsMammal: true,
			},
			ClimbFactor: 8,
		},
	}

	for _, animal := range animals {
		animal.Speak()
	}
}
```

The code returns the errors:

```sh
cannot use Dog{…} (value of type Dog) as Animal value in array or slice literal
cannot use Cat{…} (value of type Cat) as Animal value in array or slice literal
```

Why? Remember, just embedding `Animal` in each type doesn't actually make them an `Animal`; it only provides them with `Animal` attributes.

#### Red Flags

There's also some pieces of code here that raise red flags:

- `Animal` provides an abstraction layer of reusable state
- `Animal` has a `Speak` pointer receiver that is general and unlikely to be called
- No part of the program actually requires an `Animal` value

We don't want to embed for state, but for _behavior_.

### The Correct Approach 

How can we properly implement this then? We should use an `interface` instead of an `Animal` type. By doing so, we can create a group of concrete types that can `Speak`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Speaker provides common behaior that all concrete types can follow.
type Speaker interface {
	Speak()
}

// Dog contains Dog-specific capabilities.
type Dog struct {
	Name       string
	IsMammal   bool
	PackFactor int
}

// Speak knows how to speak like a Dog.
// Dog now implements Speaker.
func (d *Dog) Speak() {
	fmt.Printf("Woof! I'm %s, it's %t that I'm a mammal, and I have a pack factor of %d", d.Name, d.IsMammal, d.PackFactor)
}

// Cat contains Cat-specific capabilities.
type Cat struct {
	Name        string
	IsMammal    bool
	ClimbFactor int
}

// Speak knows how to speak like a Cat.
// Cat now implements Speaker.
func (c *Cat) Speak() {
	fmt.Printf("Meow! I'm %s, it's %t that I'm a mammal, and I have a climb factor of %d", c.Name, c.IsMammal, c.ClimbFactor)
}

func main() {
	speakers := []Speaker{
		// Create a Dog with its attributes.
		&Dog{
			Name: "Ace",
			IsMammal: true,
			PackFactor: 5,
		},
		// Create a Cat with its attributes.
		&Cat{
			Name: "Juno",
			IsMammal: true,
			ClimbFactor: 8,
		},
	}
	
	for _, spkr := range speakers {
		spkr.Speak()
	}
}
```

Now, the program outputs

```
Woof! I'm Ace, it's true that I'm a mammal, and I have a pack factor of 5
Meow! I'm Juno, it's true that I'm a mammal, and I have a climb factor of 8
```

Grouping these animals together based on what they do rather than what they are is key in decoupling.

### Guidelines for Declaring Types

Useful insights for declaring types include

1. Validating that a value of any type is created or used on its own
2. Embedding types to reuse existing _behaviors_ that are necessary to satisfy interface requirements.
3. Questioning types that are an alias or abstraction for an existing type
   - If the first instinct when describing a type is to mention its base type, it's not worth using.
4. Questioning types whose sole purpose is to share common state
5. Declaring types that represent new or unique

For instance, regarding point 5:

Some might be tempted to define a type as follows:

```go
type Handle int
func Foo(h Handle) {...}
```

However, `Handle` is simply an integer and represents nothing new. Compiler protection isn't even warranted since we can pass a constant of kind `int` (e.g., `Foo(10)`).

In this case, we should instead do

```go
func Foo(handle int) {...}
```

to remove the unnecessary abstraction.
